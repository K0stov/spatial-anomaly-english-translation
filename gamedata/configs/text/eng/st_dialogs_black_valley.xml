        <text>That creature—called the “pseudoflesh”—is not as easy to kill as a regular flesh. Many people tell stories about it and even though I don’t really care much for legends, when I saw the creature myself I knew then that most of the stories about it were true. I remember one time I was walking around garbage when I heard a cry for help. I crouched and slowly started to make my way towards those screams but then I noticed something was off… The speech was all slurred and I could barely understand what was being said. So anyway, I crawled up to that place and hid behind the hood of an old Kamaz. I looked out, and you wouldn’t believe what I saw and heard… That pseudoflesh was screaming like a human being. I wanted to kill it as quickly as possible, but I couldn’t get my gun out in time, and it escaped.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_11">
        <text>Interesting… and you think this mutant is here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_12">
        <text>Yeah. I’m telling you, its lair is somewhere there. I can tell by its calm behavior. In that area, there is a small cave where even in very hot and sunny days, it still remains moist. The pseudoflesh is most likely in it. When we get closer, you should attack from the hill that’s located to the right while I attack from the left. When you see that awful creature, make it run towards me, and I will finish it off. But watch your back; there might be other mutants there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_13">
        <text>Got it. Should we go now?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_14">
        <text>Yes. We need to move quickly and get rid of this threat once and for all.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_15">
        <text>Show me the way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_17">
        <text>Yeah! We did it! We finally slayed the god awful creature. This is the creature. I am sure of it. Just like I saw it back then. Well, a deal’s a deal. You’ve helped me, and in return, I will help you. When I leave the Outpost, I’ll take you with me. Also, here. Take this. Extra payment for a job well done.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_18">
        <text>Don’t mention it. If you need anything else, you know where to find me. What are we gonna do now?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_19">
        <text>I’ll keep that in mind. Well, you can go back to base. As for me, I want to study this mutant a bit. Maybe I can take something that’s worth selling. When I leave the Outpost, I’ll send you a message.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_2">
        <text>Hey, merc! I take it you talked to Rasputin?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_20">
        <text>All right. See you later.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_22">
        <text>Listen, I can’t seem to find it… It’s hiding somewhere deep, and finding it is going to take forever.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_23">
        <text>Maybe someone killed it already.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_24">
        <text>I doubt that. If someone would have managed to pull that off, then we would be hearing about it nonstop. If there’s something hunters like doing, it’s bragging about their kills. If one of them would have hunted the creature down, then the entire Outpost would have known about it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_25">
        <text>All right. So what are we going to do now?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_26">
        <text>We need to inspect the other part of this dump. Let’s go to the place where I first saw it. Maybe we’ll find it there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_27">
        <text>All right. Let’s go, then…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_29">
        <text>You can go back to base. When I leave the Outpost, I’ll message you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_3">
        <text>Yeah, I talked to him. Listen, Rasputin said that you, along with some other stalker—Savage, I think—tried to blow up the Monolith construction site. Did you manage to pull it off?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_31">
        <text>So Rasputin said that you and a stalker—Savage, I think—tried to blow up the construction site that’s occupied by Monolithans. Did you succeed?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_32">
        <text>No. I don’t want to talk about it. Can we leave the Outpost already?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_33">
        <text>Well, yeah. That’s why I came here. I’m going to the bar; I have some business there. And after that, I’m heading to Yantar. If you want, you can come with. I’m heading out right now; you ready?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_34">
        <text>Yeah. I’m ready. Let’s go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_4">
        <text>Sure I can do that, but not for free. Money is not what I need, though. Instead, I need your help with a mission. If you help me with that, then I’ll take you with me when I leave the Outpost. Deal?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_5">
        <text>All right. What sort of help do you need?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_6">
        <text>I need your help with finding and killing a certain mutant.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_7">
        <text>Why won’t you ask any of the hunters? They have more experience with that sort of thing.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_8">
        <text>Well, the thing is that I’m hunting this mutant for the scientists; they’ve asked me to bring a piece of its flesh for further research. They promised to pay me a hefty sum for a job well done, but if I take the entire group, then everyone would want a piece, and there isn’t enough to go around for everyone. Taking only one person with me is also out of the question, as it can create unnecessary conflict, if you know what I mean. I’d rather take someone from outside our group and not tell them that I’m doing this in the first place. It’s better that way. So are you with me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_hunter_9">
        <text>Sure. I’ll help you. First, though, tell me what mutant we’re hunting here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_11">
        <text>Hey, Beast. What’s up?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_12">
        <text>Not yet… And I doubt I’ll ever forget about it. Either way, we made it out, and that’s what’s important. Now we can get back on with our lives. Soon, perhaps, I can see my family again. As for now, though, I need some alone time. I’ll talk to you later…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_13">
        <text>All right. I hope everything turns out okay.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_2">
        <text>Finally, you’re out, Beast. Man, was that Saurel guy stubborn, but I did manage to convince him to free you. How are you feeling?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_3">
        <text>Not too bad… By the way, the guard told me that Marcus didn’t make it out of the anomaly. What the hell happened?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_4">
        <text>Yeah… It’s true we couldn’t contact you or Marcus, so Forester went back to look for the two of you, but he only found you. I hope everything’s all right with him. Being trapped alone inside the spatial anomaly must be maddening… Let’s hope that c Forester reach Red Forest he can send Marcus the coordinates and he can find his way out.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_5">
        <text>Yeah. Let’s all hope he can find his way out. So how’s everyone else? Is anyone from our group still here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_6">
        <text>No. Everyone left with the guide yesterday. You can’t blame them, though, after what they’ve been through. I won’t be surprised if most of them end up leaivng the Zone after this.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_7">
        <text>All right… And what about you? What plans do you have for the future?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_8">
        <text>I’m not planning to go anywhere anytime soon; I’ve decided to stay in the Outpost for a while and try to forget about that god forsaken anomaly.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_lutiy_9">
        <text>And have you managed to forget about it, even slightly?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_marchuk_0">
        <text>Looks like it’s over… Thanks, merc. We wouldn’t have pulled it off alone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_marchuk_1">
        <text>You shouldn’t thank me just yet. There still a chance the bandits could attack again. Saurel told me you found out about this attack by listening in on the bandits’ hidden radio frequency, right? Do you have a radio tuned for said frequency?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_marchuk_2">
        <text>Yeah. Totally. We should check if anyone was able to inform the bandits about our ambush.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_marchuk_3">
        <text>Yeah. We need to know what the bandits are planning.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_marchuk_end_0">
        <text>Damn it. They’ve sent another squad here. What should we do, merc?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_marchuk_end_1">
        <text>Don’t panic. You two should get back to your position and prepare for our “guests.” As for me, I’m going back to my sniper spot in the attic.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_10">
        <text>Yeah, yeah. I know that already. Just listen ’til the end and then decide, okay?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_11">
        <text>Go on, then.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_12">
        <text>I bet you know about the big Monolith platoon nearby, right? Well, these assholes have been a thorn in everyone’s ass for a long time. They’ve killed five of my guys alone. But I doubt I need to tell you how these Monolithians are a threat to everyone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_13">
        <text>And…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_14">
        <text>To make matters worse, they’re always receiving backup and ammunition from somewhere, and their base is constantly growing. Soon, there won’t be enough room for all of them. They’ll take over the whole Outpost, killing us all off in the process. It seems as though the only option is to get out of here, but not long ago, we managed to find out who’s in command of the platoon. Werewolf is his name, but that’s not the only thing we know: we also know how to kill him without taking any casualties. And perhaps even wipe out some of his close friends while we’re at it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_15">
        <text>Interesting… And how do you plan to pull it off?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_16">
        <text>Swiftly and quietly. Two days ago, one of my fighters pulled out a guy out of a Zharka. Well, he turned out be a Monolithian… and not just any regular Monolithian, but one of the high ranks in Werewolf’s platoon. We managed to get some info out of him. It turns out that tomorrow, Werewolf is heading to a meeting with some other high ranking Monolith officer. This meeting will take place in the factory with a minimal amount of security.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_17">
        <text>And you think two important Monolith officers won’t have good security with them?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_18">
        <text>I never said that. Obviously, the people guarding Werewolf and that other dude would be real professionals, but the thing is that this meeting is so secret that a regular Monolith soldier won’t even know about it. We need all the help we can get here. To tell the truth, at first, I didn’t want any outside help, but because these assholes iced five of our best guys, we have little to no chance of pulling off this operation now. That’s why we’re taking all the help we can find, and we could really use the help of a skilled fighter such as you. So what do you say?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_19">
        <text>I need to think about it…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_2">
        <text>No pasaran! Hey, Beast. It’s good to see you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_20">
        <text>All right, Miklukha. I’m down with the job…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_21">
        <text>There’s no time to think. The meeting is going to take place soon, and we need to use our remaining time to prepare for the assault. More than that, though, we most likely won’t get another chance like this one seeing how the number of Monolithians is only increasing, and soon they will wipe us all out.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_22">
        <text>I knew you were a good dude. All right. If you’re in, then we should get going at once and prepare for the ambush at the factory.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_23">
        <text>Show me the way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_25">
        <text>I can’t talk now, Beast. I’m too busy…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_3">
        <text>Do I know you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_4">
        <text>Oh, yeah. Forgot to introduce myself. My name’s Miklukha; commander of this Freedom squad. As for you, there’s no need to introduce yourself. I’ve already heard all about you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_5">
        <text>And what have you heard about me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_6">
        <text>Nothing too good, to be honest. However, I do know for a fact that you are a professional, and I just so happen to need someone like you for a job.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_7">
        <text>What’s the job?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_8">
        <text>I need someone really dangerous taken out.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_miklucha_9">
        <text>Sorry, but I can’t help you with that. I’m done being a hitman.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_leader_0">
        <text>Greetings, servant of the Monolith. What brings you here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_leader_1">
        <text>We came here to strengthen the Monolith’s might on this earth.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_leader_2">
        <text>We did not expect any reinforcements today… Where do you come from, and why are there only two of you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_leader_3">
        <text>Um… I was sent here by my priest, along with five others. We came here through Limansk. Our path was full of tests and challenges that the Monolith prepared for us. However, not everyone withstood the Monolith’s test, and only two of us survived. We were supposed to arrive here a few days later, but the Monolith showed us a faster way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_leader_4">
        <text>Bless the Monolith, for he is the one who helped you get here. As for your fallen brothers, do not fear. All is for the good of the Monolith.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_leader_5">
        <text>I’ll be on my way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_scene_0">
        <text>Thank the Monolith, infidel, for he is the one who spared your life… If it was up to me, I would have killed you on the spot, but the Monolith forbids me to do so because he chose you for his trial. We are holding your friend hostage, just in case you want to save him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_scene_1">
        <text>You have Savage? What sick game are you playing?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_scene_2">
        <text>Silence, infidel! I am the only one who is allowed to speak here. Our prophet took your friend away to the north. I’ve marked the exact location on your PDA. If you want to save him, I suggest you go there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_monolit_scene_3">
        <text>I don’t need your suggestions on what to do.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_11">
        <text>All right. We’re here. I’m going to stay in the village for a while. If you need my services, I’ll be here in the neighboring house. Good luck, merc.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_12">
        <text>You too.</text>

        <text>Hey, merc. You need to get somewhere?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_16">
        <text>Can you get me to the metallurgical factory?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_17">
        <text>Not yet.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_18">
        <text>Sure I can. And since you’re doing Saurel’s assignment, I won’t charge you money for this trip. So are you ready to move out?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_19">
        <text>Yeah. Let’s go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_2">
        <text>Hey there, merc. You the one who iced these bandits? I was nearby and heard some gunshots, so I decided to check what’s up. I thought the bandits were attacking stalkers again, so I wanted to lend a hand. Needless to say, there’s no problem here. What about you? You looking for something, or are you just passing through?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_20">
        <text>Well, we’re here. I’ll stay here and wait for you. When you decide to get back to the northern village, come see me again. Just keep in mind that I won’t wait here *too* long.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_21">
        <text>All right, then. I don’t think I’ll take long.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_23">
        <text>So, merc, are you ready to get back the northern village?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_24">
        <text>Yeah. We need to tell Saurel that someone killed Lefty.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_25">
        <text>Yeah. It’s a bit of a shituation, if you ask me… Lefty was a good dude, even though he did kill his friend.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_26">
        <text>I doubt Lefty’s the one behind Limp’s murder. Lefty also got killed. The real killer’s probably trying to tie up any loose ends.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_27">
        <text>If you say so. It’s none of my business anyway. We heading back to the village or what?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_28">
        <text>Yeah. Let’s go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_3">
        <text>I was sent here by Saurel; that’s all you need to know.</text>

        <text>Hey, merc. You need to get somewhere?</text>

    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_31">
        <text>I need to get the metal factory again. Will you get me there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_32">
        <text>Of course. You helped us, so I’ll help you. Ready to move.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_33">
        <text>Yeah. Let’s move.</text>

    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_37">
        <text>I need to get to the anomalous grove. Can you get me there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_38">
        <text>I’d be happy to get you there, but the problem is that the place is always filled with either boars or bandits. I’d much rather just get you to the village that’s nearby, where it’s way safer. And from *there*, you can continue on your own. Or I can get you to the metal factory which is not that far off, if you like. So, what do you say?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_39">
        <text>A Freedomer by the name of Miklukha told me to come by; he gave me his coordinates. His location is way far off, and I need someone to show me a safe path. Can you do that?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_4">
        <text>So you’re that mercenary who was trapped inside that spatial anomaly? In that case, I won’t ask too many questions. Just tell me one thing: are you heading to the northern village by any chance?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_40">
        <text>I need to get to the old school. Can you lead me there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_41">
        <text>All right. Let’s go to that village.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_42">
        <text>Tell you what, lead me to the metal factory and from there I’ll go on my own.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_43">
        <text>I changed my mind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_46">
        <text>Miklukha? Yeah, I know the guy. He organized a small base with his buds in the old school. We can head out right now, if you like. So, are you ready?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_47">
        <text>Yeah, Let’s go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_48">
        <text>Sorry merc, I can’t get you to the old school, seeing how freedom has abandoned it and I’ve heard that bandits have taken over that place.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_49">
        <text>Fine, forget about it then.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_5">
        <text>Yeah. I’m going there; I need to talk to Saurel.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_50">
        <text>Will you get me to the village near the anomalous grove?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_51">
        <text>Yeah, no problem. Are you ready?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_52">
        <text>Yeah, let’s go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_53">
        <text>Sure, no problem. Are you ready to move out now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_54">
        <text>Yeah, let’s go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_6">
        <text>Wanna go together? I know all the safe routes around these parts. Plus, it’ll be less boring that way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_7">
        <text>Are you a guide? Can you get me out of the Outpost?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_8">
        <text>No. I’m just a guy who knows the insides of this place but as for getting out of here, that’s a whole different story. The area around the Outpost is filled with dangerous anomalous and only a real pro can lead you out of here safely. We have a guide who hangs in the northern village, I don’t know if he’s there right now though. So are you coming or what?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_provodnik_9">
        <text>Yeah, let’s go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_11">
        <text>Hey, Beast. What’s up?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_13">
        <text>Saurel told me that Lefty’s dead. That true?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_14">
        <text>Afraid so. Rasputin, can you help me with something? You pretty much know every stalker in the base, right?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_15">
        <text>May he rest in peace… As for the stalkers here, Yeah. I know all of them. I’m the barman, after all. Why?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_16">
        <text>Can you tell me who this knife belongs to?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_17">
        <text>That’s Chemist’s knife. He was looking for it all over the place. He was really nervous he couldn’t find it; kept yelling and cursing while messing up the place.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_18">
        <text>Where is he now?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_19">
        <text>When he was looking for the knife, he said he remembered where he left and that was going there to take it. Give the knife to Chemist when you get the chance.</text>

        <text>Hey, merc.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_20">
        <text>All right. I’ll be on my way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_22">
        <text>Hey, merc. You wanna buy something or what?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_24">
        <text>You here on business, Beast?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_26">
        <text>So it turns out Chemist killed Lefty? Damn. He had us all fooled… At least that asshole’s dead.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_27">
        <text>I made him pay for what he did. Listen, I still have his knife… Maybe you wanna buy it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_28">
        <text>I made him pay for what he did.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_29">
        <text>Hmm… It’s a good knife, so I’ll give you 3000 rubles for it, deal?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_3">
        <text>I’m not a mercenary anymore. What do you need?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_30">
        <text>Deal, here you go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_31">
        <text>Nah, I’ll keep it for myself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_32">
        <text>All right, here’s you cash. So are you in here on buisness or what?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_33">
        <text>Man, why you gotta be like that? Fine, I’ll buy it for 4500 rubles, that’s the most I’m willing to pay for it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_34">
        <text>Fine, here you go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_35">
        <text>Money isn’t the problem here, It’s just that this knife might come in handy.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_36">
        <text>Great! Here’s your cash. By the way, are you here on business or did you just come here to sell the knife?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_37">
        <text>Fine, if you don’t want to sell it, it’s your choice. I was wondering… Are you here on business or did you just come here for a drink? If it’s the former, I have some jobs I need taken care of.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_38">
        <text>Man, thanks for getting rid of that scumbag. I was wondering… Are you here on business or did you just come here for a drink? If it’s the former, I have some jobs I need taken care of.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_39">
        <text>Yeah, Saurel told me that you might have some jobs for me and seeing as how the guide won’t be here for a while, I might as well earn some extra cash.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_4">
        <text>Sure thing pal… There’s no such thing as an ex-mercenary. Everyone calls me Rasputin here by the way and you are Beast right?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_40">
        <text>Yeah, I have a job for you, nothing too hard… So, one of my regulars spotted a rare artifact inside the anomalous grove near the metal factor. The artifact in question is a Kolobok, and I want it. The guy who told me about, couldn’t get it. He told me that the artifact is located on the tallest tree there and when he tried to get he fell off the tree and almost broke his neck. Anyway, can you do this for me? All you have to do get the artifact and comeback.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_41">
        <text>Are you sure it’s still there?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_42">
        <text>I doubt anyone managed to get their hands on it, it’s not like we have many rock climbers here. I’ll even give you a Veles detector so you can find what I need more easily. So, are you in?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_43">
        <text>All right. I’ll get you that artifact.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_44">
        <text>Great! Here’s the detector and coordinates to that place in case you forgot where it is.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_45">
        <text>Got it. All right, I’ll be on my way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_47">
        <text>Have you gotten that aritfact yet?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_48">
        <text>Yeah, I’ve got the artifact. It took some real effort getting that thing, what’s more is after I’ve got it, I was ambushed by bandits.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_49">
        <text>You don’t say? And what did you do?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_5">
        <text>Okay…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_50">
        <text>It doesn’t matter, the important thing is the artifact is with me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_51">
        <text>Nothing, I just ran off with the artifact, and they couldn’t catch up to me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_52">
        <text>Not yet.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_53">
        <text>You did the right thing, they got what they deserved. The bandits have really gotten out of control and this isn’t the first time they are robbing someone here. All right, give me the artifact.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_54">
        <text>Here you go..</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_55">
        <text>Man, have these bandits gotten out of control; this isn’t the first time they pull this shit. Someone needs to tell Saurel about this shit.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_56">
        <text>Here you go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_57">
        <text>And here’s your reward, just like I promised. If you find anymore artifacts bring them here, I’ll buy them from you, I take them at price higher than anyone else around here, you can trust me on that. By the way, Saurel said he wanted to see you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_58">
        <text>Here’s your reward, pleasure doing business with you, merc.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_59">
        <text>All right, I’ll go see what he wants.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_6">
        <text>Listen, Beast, I know that Saurel told you to deal with Lefty but I doubt he is the want who killed Limp. They were good friends and they could kill for one another. I’ve never seen friendship as tight as theirs.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_61">
        <text>Welcome to my bar, Beast. Are you here on buisness or just to chill?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_62">
        <text>I had the artifact but it was stolen by bandits.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_63">
        <text>What!? And you let them steal it? I know you quit being a mercenary but this is too much. How could you just let them take the artifact? Yeah, I never thought you’d pull some like this.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_64">
        <text>I don’t really care what you thought… I’m not going to risk my life for your artifact.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_65">
        <text>Whatever, no point in arguing over it now. I should have asked someone else to this job anyway. By the way Saurel told me he wants to see you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_66">
        <text>Okay, I’ll go talk to him, later.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_68">
        <text>Greetings, Beast! Listen, a stalker who hunts mutants came to the Outpost not too long ago. He said he needs a good marksman for a job so I instantly thought of you. This stalker is the leader of the group of hunters that hangs out near the wagon and his nickname is Hunter. Have you heard about him before?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_69">
        <text>No, I haven’t heard of him. That’s one stupid nickname by the way, a hunter named Hunter. Do you know anything about him?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_7">
        <text>So what? They were both dead drunk. Moreover, I’ve seen something similar happen before.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_70">
        <text>Oh, yeah, I have plenty of stories about Hunter, I’ve known him for a long time. As a matter of fact everyone knows and respects him… and some even fear him. He’s a good friend and partner and a good fighter. He has been everywhere in the zone and has been in it since 2006. He said himself that the zone is the best place for him. He adapted to this place quickly because even before the zone’s emergence he was a hunter. After he came to the zone he started selling mutant parts to people who needed them in the outside world. For a while he also worked as a guide for tourists who wanted to see the zone and hunt a few small mutants for fun. There’s rich people who would pay for something like that. One guy, an American, came here to make a documentary film about the zone. It was the first and last tourist lead by Hunter who died. Since then, Hunter stopped working as a guide for tourists. It’s also from where Hunter got his nickname. The American kept calling him “Hunter”.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_71">
        <text>What does he need done?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_72">
        <text>I didn’t ask. Why don’t you go talk to him and see what he wants?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_73">
        <text>All right, I’ll go talk to him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_75">
        <text>Welcome to my bar, Beast. Are you here on buisness or just to chill?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_76">
        <text>I think that you’ll make the right choice… By the way, if you want to make some extra cash then bring some mutant parts, I can pay for them. It’s one of the easiest ways of making money here in the Outpost if you know how to field dress a mutant.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_77">
        <text>All right, I’ll keep that in mind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_8">
        <text>Even drunk, Lefty is not the guy who would kill his best friend. Beast, I’m only asking to let Lefty explain himself before you ice him. Maybe he’ll be able to convince you otherwise.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_shaman_9">
        <text>All right, We’ll see how things pan out.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_10">
        <text>Well, he couldn’t have gotten very far. More than that, he’s still here in the Outpost. Although, I don’t know where exactly.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_11">
        <text>All right. I’ll try to find him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_13">
        <text>What’s up, merc?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_15">
        <text>So Beast, have you dealt with our problem?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_16">
        <text>We haven’t even found out who even is the “problem,” so no.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_17">
        <text>What’s that supposed to mean?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_18">
        <text>Lefty didn’t kill Limp. I talked to him and I could tell he wasn’t lying. Lefty told me about how he and Limp got some good loot and that they were drinking to celebrate and when they were drinking they told a few other guys about their successful raid, hence Lefty isn’t the only one with the motive to kill Limp. Also, when Lefty left after fighting with Limp he was captured by bandits so that means he couldn’t have made it back to base. It’s very unlikely that Lefty is the one who killed Limp.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_19">
        <text>All right, Tell you what, bring Lefty here and we will question everyone who drank with him that night.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_2">
        <text>Listen up, merc. I’ve heard of your fine “work,” and if you try anything funny I will deal with you accordingly. Are we clear on that?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_20">
        <text>All right. I’ll go get Lefty.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_22">
        <text>Beast, where’s Lefty? Did you bring him to our base?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_23">
        <text>Lefty’s dead, somebody is “cleaning up” after themselves.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_24">
        <text>Man, what a scumbag… We got to find whoever did this as soon as possible.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_25">
        <text>Let’s not rush it, it’s not like we can revive the dead and if you we move to early more innocent people might get hurt. Don’t worry, I’ll find out who did this and I’ll deal with him, all right?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_26">
        <text>Yeah, okay. As long as you get it done.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_27">
        <text>By the way did you find out with whom the two were drinknig?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_28">
        <text>Yeah: Burnt and Chemist.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_29">
        <text>I’ll find out soon enough.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_3">
        <text>Don’t worry, after what’ve been through in spatial anomaly, I’ve decided to stop being a mercenary.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_31">
        <text>Beast, get to Lefty, we wil talk later.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_33">
        <text>So Beast, any luck finding the murderer?</text>

        <text>What? Are you sure? I never thought Chemist would be able to do something like this… He was one of my best and most trusted men, and what a piece of shit he turned out to be. Well… May both Lefty and Limp rest in peace.</text>

        <text>There’s no way out of the Outpost right now, seeing as all the ways out are blocked off. One path has been taken over by Monolithians, who are constantly patrolling it.

        <text>We managed to find a hidden bandit radio frequency, so we set up a few radios tuned to it. One day, when we were listening in, we over heard that the bandits are getting ready to attack our base at night. They plan to free the bandits that are being held captive here. I think we need to stop their plan from happening, will you give us a hand?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_56">

    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_57">
        <text>The plan is that we occupy the village near the anomalous grove and when the bandits come three of us will take them at the front, one guy will take sniper position and the rest will shoot them from the abandoned buildings nearby.

    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_8">
        <text>Something awful has happened, about a day before you came here. Long story short, one stalker slit another stalker’s throat. They had an altercation that lead to a fight beforehand and after a while one of them was found dead. The dead guy’s name is Limp and as for the other guy, his name is Lefty.

        <text>Can you Answer a few of my questions?</text>

        <text>Ask away.</text>

        <text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_22">
        <text>Tell me about the zone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_221">
        <text>Ask away, I’ll tell you what I know.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_222">
        <text>Since my first day, I’ve been wondering is the zone really expanding or is that just a rumor.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223001">
        <text>What do you think? Of course, it’s the truth. Way back when, the zone was a lot smaller than it is now. When the zone only emerged, it borders where north of the rostok bar. I can’t tell you where exactly, I don’t know but what we do know is that the zone’s first border was somewhere around the Army Warehouses.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223002">
        <text>How fast is it expanding? Right now there are plenty of anomalies here, were there really less of them here before?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223003">
        <text>You can believe what you want but a year back this place was devoid of anomalies completely. Five years ago this place wasn’t even considered the zone and back then the army had an outpost in the northern part Garbage, but after the zone started to expand the military was forced to relocate. Why it’s expanding so rapidly, that’s not a question for me but rather for one of those eggheads in Yantar. The zone expands in bursts, usually after an emission. Back then the emission were a lot rarer, they would occur about once a month and they were a lot more powerful than they are right now. The zone would expand along with these powerful blowouts however with time the blowouts started to become less powerful. Though the frequency in which they occur has been increasing ever since. Nowadays, we have a blowout every few days but it wasn’t always like that.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223004">
        <text>What will happen to the zone’s barrier? from what I understand it’s not the first border the government has set up.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223005">
        <text>Well, you got that right. The barrier in Cordon is the third border they’ve set up until now. They’ve started building it when the zone started to expand for the first time. Back then, a lot of people died near the perimeter, some died from the blowout but most of them died from mutant attacks. Nobody ever seen anything like it before, the amount of mutants that was coming from the center was enormous, there were thousands of them. The government in turn, sent everything they had at them; they turned this place into a warzone. Tanks, helicopters, artillery and everything in between were here to fight off this insane wave of mutants. At one point the wanted to carpet bomb the whole place but lucky for us the mutants stopped coming at that point. After that incident, the world started to take the zone a lot more seriously. Instead of restoring the old perimeter they’ve put a few pillboxes around Garbage and they didn’t stop there. In case a threat would get passed Garbage they would have a backup solution, the military outpost in cordon used to be that backup solution.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223006">
        <text>Why does the Cordon outpost look so weird? What I mean is why does it look like a military warehouse more than anything? Same thing with the wall they built around the zone, why does it go over the perimeter?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223007">
        <text>That’s because that place was never supposed to be a military outpost but rather a warehouse where all sorts of military technology would be stored and repaired. It was also used to refuel and repair vehicles that would carry cargo in and out of the CNPP. And after that wave of mutants that mentioned early emerged, the military took over that warehouse and made it their base. As for the wall, they only started building it after the blowout struck and because the engineers worked in a hurry they’ve made some kind of calculation mistake and as result the wall was actually built south of the outpost. Then, however, they tried to rebuild it so that at least the wall would cover some of the outside buildings and that’s what they got as a result.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223008">
        <text>Where are the gates though, when I was looking they weren’t there, just an open enterance.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_223009">
        <text>They aren’t there anymore, they got rid of them. A few months ago a big flock of mutants smashed through those gates. The strange thing was that they were no blowouts that day. Out of nowhere a flock of boars and fleshed appeared and started breaking through the barrier, killing a few soldiers in the process. Then when the military called in a chopper something completely bizarre occurred, the mutants instantly ran away as if they knew a chopper was on the way. Instead of repairing the gates they decided to just get rid of them seeing as how they were going to build a second barrier anyway. Did you see it by the way? It looks amazing, a fine piece of work indeed. Everything there is as it should be: flamethrowers, mortars, fortified trenches and pillboxes, it’s all there. Hell, the minefield alone is a work of art, not a single rodent can get passed it. They must’ve spent billions on this new barrier, considering all the gear that’s located there. NATO takes its defense budget seriously it would seem.</text>

        <text>Nope. What about them?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_333">
        <text>Well, a year ago Rasputin got a job off to escort three foreigners through the zone. He was promised really good cash, so he agreed. However, he is a smart guy, so he checked up through what they had in store for him. He found out through his sources that these foreigners were no regular tourists but rather CIA agents. Rasputin didn’t want to lose the cash he was promised but at the same time he didn’t want to screw over the stalker that would take the job.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_3330001">
        <text>So, what did he do?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_3330002">
        <text>He told me about his situation and after a while we both came up with a solution. We picked someone who could really handle himself, Elijah Muromski. That guy was tough as nails, two meters tall, huge shoulders, and strong as hell. One time he broke a boar’s neck with his bare hands just for the hell of it. So if you something would go down, he could handle it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_3330003">
        <text>So, what happened then?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_3330004">
        <text>Elijah arrived on time and met the tourists after which he led them to the designated places. The tourists wanted to inspect the mutants from a far and take a few pictures and maybe even hunt a few of them. But Elijah could barely speak any English and he couldn’t understand what his clients wanted from him. They only thing Elijah understood was that our guests wanted to hunt down some mutants and so that what he did for the entire trip.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_3330005">
        <text>I think I’m starting to see where this is going…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_3330006">
        <text>No you don’t, stop interrupting and listen. For three days Elijah escorted our American clients. He went everywhere with this guys and showed them everything. In the Agroprom Underground they were attacked by a bloodsucker that almost killed one of tourists. In Yantar Elijah “accidently” forgot to mention that they were zombies there so when one of the corpses stood up, one guy almost had a heart attack. When they were traveling between one location and another he would “accidently” run into flocks of boars and other small time mutants. On the third day Elijah suggested they would sleep in the construction site that was located in Dark Valley, he of course “forgot” to mention that there were burers there. I don’t even know who was more sacred, the burers at the sight of Elijah, or the Americans who were dead frightened of the burers. When Elijah told us about this, our stomachs almost burst from laughter. That’s not all though. The next morning the tourists wanted to go home so they went to Sidorovich so that he could smuggle them back across the border. However the same day this tourist planned to leave, a group of three guys came to the zone, they were escorted through the border by the military. It turned out that this was a CIA group sent in to the zones for some kind special preparation program. Sidorovich was dumbfounded, why send one CIA group and then another one right after? He asked the tourists why did the CIA do this to which they replayed in broken Russian that they weren’t CIA and had nothing to do with them.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_3330007">
        <text>So all this time, Elijah was just scarring a few American tourists… Ha-ha-ha. Damn, that’s too funny.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_3330008">
        <text>Yeah, he almost gave them a heart attack. By the way, the real spies were also escorted by Elijah, in the same route. The burers were happy about it, ha!</text>

    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_44002">
        <text>Well, the town’s main export was gas and oil and even wood and I could always find work in those area. But since childhood I had a need for adventure, I just couldn’t imagine myself being stuck in one place for the rest of my life. At the time I travelled through every forest in the nearby region. When I turned 18, I joined the military. For me, it was the only way to get out of that island and see the world.</text>

    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_5">
        <text>How did you get here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_52001">
        <text>That’s a tough one… I don’t know whether it was a chain of coincidences or the zone itself choice me but here I am. Back in the army, I excelled in every aspect. I loved sports since I was a small kid so serving two years in a spetznaz wasn’t too bad. Even though, when I got recruited, the war in Afghanistan didn’t end yet but was nearing its end. I was barely sent to any warzones and didn’t get fight much. When the war finally ended, I was sent to military school where I got a military career. While I was in school, I met a woman whom I married. I didn’t have any kids though; for the best as it turns out. After I finished school, I would travel from one garrison to another so I didn’t have time for kids. After that I was sent to Chechnya, so kids were once again out of the question. When I was in Chechnya, my wife decide to visit me at the base. The base was attacked by Chechen terrorists and my wife was killed. Man, was I an idiot for letting her set foot in such an awful place…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_52002">
        <text>Sorry, I don’t know… Didn’t mean to remind you…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_52003">
        <text>Forget about it, it’s my cross to bear and I’ll have to live with it for the rest of my life. Maybe, that’s why the zone lead me to here, what do you think? I’ve been through a lot after the first Chechen war, so much that I can’t tell it all right now. Nevertheless, I remember the day the zone emerged like it was yesterday. You just can’t forget such chaos. In the first few hours nobody could even understand what was going on, people weren’t sure whether the reactor exploded, a meteorite fell, or this was the beginning of a nuclear war. Moscow was just as riled up as Kiev was. And that was when we were sent to the zone, I’ll never forget that day. I almost lost my entire team because of those bureaucratic rats. To them it was no big deal throwing soldiers’ lives away, considering they just had to know what those anomalies were capable of, bastards. How I, Dima and Sergey made it out alive, I still don’t know, the zone must have been guiding us. Anyway, when we made to the HQ, I was ready to shoot the general who ordered this operation. I almost did it, I had the gun pointed between his eyes but I was captured in time. After that, I was thrown in jail. If it wasn’t for my friends who helped me escape, I would probably be stuck in some Russian prison right now. After I escaped the military camp, I had two choices: either live in the zone, or spend the rest of my life hiding in the outside world. I choose the former. I rather live freely in the zone, than be rotting in some shitty prison.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_52004">
        <text>Yeah, that’s one hell of a story. Do you ever miss your hometown?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_from_stavrid_about_52005">
        <text>You know, at first I didn’t miss it at all; I was too busy trying to stay alive. Back then, the zone was a lot more dangerous than it is now and it was almost completely devoid of people to boot. Even though, I’m an experienced soldiers and I’ve seen all the horrors of war, none of them could compared to what I’ve seen in the zone. When your friend gets caught in an anomaly, flies up in the area and gets torn to shreds, you stop feeling anything but fear. Nevertheless, you can’t lose skill and so I managed to survive somehow. After sometime, when I gained some experience and got a bit more comfortable here, that’s when I started to feel a longing for home. Nowadays, I really want to go home. See my parents one last time, I don’t even know if they are alive or not. I’m even willing to go sit in prison if in the end I’ll get to return home.</text>

        <text>Way back when, we had a guy in the Outpost who would make figurines, it was his hobby. One time, he got the idea to make a figurine out of every mutant in the zone and since he had such a good photographic memory, the statuettes he made were really accurate. After a while that guy disappeared somewhere but his figurines remained; he sold all of them to the local stalkers. I started to develop a liking for those figurines when I got my hands on the bloodsucker sculpture and after that I wanted to complete the entire collection. I think if you look around the stashes in the Outpost and ask around the stalkers then perhaps you can find something. So, what do you say, help me out here?

        <text>He’s been begging for it for quite a while. I was going to give it away, but he already sent you on a hunt for all the figures. So if he really wants it, then take it. I’ll get something else to replace it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_actor_meet_shaman_about_toy_5">
        <text>Well, okay. If you need it so badly, take it. Was just curious why you needed it…</text>

        <text>Thanks. You’ve helped me out good. See you.</text>

        <text>Yo, man! You wanna take a few shots at the ravens?</text>

        <text>I do.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_hello_1111">
        <text>Great. I’ve got games for fun, for money, or for a record. Take your pick.</text>

        <text>Nah. I don’t feel like it.</text>

        <text>’Kay, man. I’m always here if you change your mind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_hello_21">
        <text>Here’s your stuff, like we agreed. All fair and square. So, you wanna go for some more?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_hello_31">
        <text>It really do be like that sometimes. You wanna try again?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_hello_41">
        <text>Where the hell were you going, man? Shooting behind the fence? That ain’t part of the game. Maybe you wanna have a go by the rules this time?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_hello_51">
        <text>Clock’s ticking! Less babbling, more shooting!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_hello_511">
        <text>Got it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_hello_61">
        <text>You shoot like a real man! You should go for money. Want to try again?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_0">
        <text>For money.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_1">
        <text>Now that’s what I like to hear! I don’t need to go over the rules with you, do I?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_11">
        <text>Yeah. Let’s start.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_111">
        <text>Not just yet, bro! So, what do you think? How many of them birdies can you get in a minute?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_111111">
        <text>Sure.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_1111111">
        <text>All right, man. Ready your gun.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_11111111">
        <text>Yeah.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_111112">
        <text>I don’t have that much money.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_1111121">
        <text>Well, can you choose something that’ll fit your pocket?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_11111211">
        <text>Yeah. I’ll pick a different amount of ravens.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_11111212">
        <text>No. Not interested.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_111112121">
        <text>Then you can play just for fun. Or for records… but that’ll drain your pockets dry. What do you say?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_12">
        <text>Tell me the rules.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_121">
        <text>Money’s the most fun out of them. You tell me how many ravens you can take out in a minute, you place your bets, and you go forward. If you win your bet, you get double the sum. If you lose, the paper’s mine. And keep in mind: the more birdies, the bigger the bet.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_money_13">
        <text>Mmm… I don’t feel like playing anymore.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_questions_0">
        <text>Are there any general rules?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_questions_1">
        <text>Basically none. I keep the time, you get ready for the signal, then rain fire. If you manage to get as many as you’ve bet in a minute, you win. How you want to take the birds out is your own choice. Just remember that if you leave the fence, the game’s off. So, what’ll it be: fun, money, or record time?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_quit_0">
        <text>Eh. I don’t like it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_quit_1">
        <text>Okay, then. If anything, I’m always here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_0">
        <text>For a record.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_11">
        <text>Let’s go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_1111">
        <text>Agreed.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_11111">
        <text>Now, let’s see what skills you got!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_1112">
        <text>Agreed, but no money.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_11121">
        <text>Then a few simpler choices: money or just for fun. What do you say?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_1113">
        <text>I’ve changed my mind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_12">
        <text>Remind me of the rules.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_121">
        <text>This is for real men. If you feel you got the strength to take the highest record, you put a bet, and not a small one either. If you get it, I’ll give you back the money you bet with twice on top… and also the title of champion, which ain’t so fucking bad. If not, I keep your paper.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_record_13">
        <text>I’ve changed my mind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_0">
        <text>For fun.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_1">
        <text>Some exercise, huh? You got the rules?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_11">
        <text>Yes. Let’s shoot.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_111">
        <text>’Kay. How many ravens are you getting?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_11111">
        <text>Okay. Come on, then. Drop ’em.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_111111">
        <text>Yep.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_21">
        <text>No. Tell me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_211">
        <text>Well, for fun… that is, if you don’t wanna earn any cash. To train, or if you’re just feeling down. You choose how many ravens you drop within a minute, and you try to do it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_31">
        <text>I’ve changed my mind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_bookmaker_training_311">
        <text>Not a question. Your choices are the same: for money or for a record. What do you say?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_gop_stop_0">
        <text>Greetings, sir. What were you doing on the tree?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_gop_stop_1">
        <text>What? Got a problem?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_gop_stop_2">
        <text>No, God forbid. Everything is fine. If you give us the artifact you found in the grove, though, it’ll be even better.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_gop_stop_3">
        <text>Oh, fuck off… You better leave the village before I leave a bullet in your head.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_gop_stop_4">
        <text>I’m not giving you anything. Go back to where you came from.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_gop_stop_5">
        <text>All right. Take the artifact and be on your way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_gop_stop_6">
        <text>That’s it! We’re feeling nice today, so be thankful that we don’t strip your clothes and make you walk around the Zone.</text>

    <string id="blck_val_bandit_gop_stop_7">
        <text>Uhuh…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_escape_0">
        <text>We’re out. Now listen up: head to the old school in the morning. I’ll be waiting there with my pals. I see you there, you get your shooters. And remember: we never had this conversation.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_escape_1">
        <text>And I know what to do without you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_escape_2">
        <text>Perfect. Take the key. Got no time to waste, so we’ll scram. Gonna wait for you at the meeting point.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_escape_3">
        <text>I’ll see you later.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_school_meet_2">
        <text>’Sup, merc! Thanks again for helping us out of that hole.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_school_meet_3">
        <text>Let’s not beat around the bush. You got my weapons?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_school_meet_4">
        <text>Of course. I keep my word… These babies are brand new; haven’t even been fired yet. Everything’s just right. By the way, I hope nobody caught word of our deal yesterday?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_school_meet_5">
        <text>No. Everything went fine. Give me the guns.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_school_meet_6">
        <text>They’re all yours. Here. And some more info for ya: go see Bookmaker in the yard. He can organize some real fun for you, not to mention the money in it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_school_meet_7">
        <text>Great. I’ll head there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_school_meet_9">
        <text>Look who showed up.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_10">
        <text>He-he. Just try and get me. So we have a deal? I’ll wait for the key at nighttime.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_11">
        <text>Yeah. We have a deal.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_13">
        <text>So, did you retrieve the key?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_14">
        <text>Yes. I have the key.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_15">
        <text>Still haven’t found it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_16">
        <text>Beautiful, merc. Give it to me. Time is short, and we need to get out of here without a sound.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_17">
        <text>Hold your horses. How are we going to return the key back to where it was?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_18">
        <text>I know: we’ll meet by the house. You go now and wait for me there while I open this cell with my bro and sneak out in your direction. I’ll mark the exact place for you, where I’ll give you the key.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_19">
        <text>And when will I get the gun?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_2">
        <text>Hey, merc! I heard you’re looking for a Vikhr gun. I could help you out with that, but I’m gonna need a little something from you first.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_20">
        <text>We’ll talk everything out when we’re out of here. Need to get out before the stalkers notice anything. Wait for me at the place we agreed on.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_21">
        <text>Okay. Here’s the key.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_22">
        <text>Great. Now, you head off and wait for me at the meeting point.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_23">
        <text>Got it. I’m heading out.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_25">
        <text>Merc, what the hell are you still doing here? Go to our agreed meeting point. Don’t waste time.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_26">
        <text>I’ll think about your offer.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_28">
        <text>So, what’ll it be, merc? You gonna help us out of this shithole?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_29">
        <text>I haven’t decided yet.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_3">
        <text>What do you want?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_30">
        <text>I have the key.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_31">
        <text>Well, it’s nice that you have the key and all, but the moon’s yet to rise… and we need to get out at nighttime. Come back later; preferably after midnight.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_32">
        <text>Okay. I’ll come back at nighttime.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_4">
        <text>What do you think? I wanna get out of this hole. If you help me, I could part with a nice shooter. Don’t worry: you won’t have to drop anyone. You just need to find the key for this cell.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_5">
        <text>And how do you want to go about finding it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_6">
        <text>It won’t be that hard. There are two keys for this cage: one’s held by Saurel while the other is… or, was, guarded by Chemist. Chemist’s key, however, is held by Sologub right now. I heard from a stalker that Sologub just leaves his key on his nightstand while he’s out like a light. You just need to fetch the key while he’s asleep, and after we’re out of here, return the key back to where you took it from. If everything goes as planned, they won’t even know a thing.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_7">
        <text>Sounds like a plan, but how can I trust your offer?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_8">
        <text>Trust? Hah. You can trust me. I gave you my word, and I always keep it. Especially since you have no way out of this place without a gun… and I have two of those. I’m not looking for any funny business. You won’t be getting any gun without my help. They’re guarded by quite a serious man, and he gives them only to me. If we get out of here, I’ll give them both to you. I swear.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_bandit_shmiga_talk_quest_9">
        <text>Looks like I have no choice. But if you try to trick me, you’re as good as dead.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_barman_radio_off_0">
        <text>Rasputin, turn off the radio.</text>
    </string>

        <text>Yeah? Sure. Getting tired of it myself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_barman_radio_off_2">
        <text>Done. Were you building up a headache there?</text>

    <string id="blck_val_barman_radio_on_2">
        <text>Man, I wouldn’t mind listening to a good song myself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_barman_radio_on_3">
        <text>Done. Listen to your heart’s content. It’s the only thing that’s free of charge here.</text>

    <string id="blck_val_chimik_killer_meet_0">
        <text>What the…?! Oh. It’s you, merc… Go back to where you came.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_chimik_killer_meet_1">
        <text>I just came here with the intent of helping you. Isn’t that a good thing?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_chimik_killer_meet_2">
        <text>You’ve tired me already. What are you doing poking your nose into other people’s business? I should’ve ended you when you were doing time. Now hold on.</text>

        <text>What do you think? Of course we do. Not only that, but the job we have is a dirty one. We need six blind dog tails for an assignment given to us by the scientists. We will be very grateful if you help us out with this. Are you in?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_hunter_dop_quest_dialog_2">

        <text>Thank you. I’ll be going now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_10">
        <text>Well, anyone. Listen: I went on a hike with Limp not long ago, and the Zone gave us a special gift. Basically, we encountered a load of artifacts and crammed it all into a container that we agreed to hide. From there, we split up. Limp managed to return to the base before I did. All in all, we were feeling happy and generous, so we shared a few drinks with another pair of stalkers. Next, the dimwit tells me that he brought the container to the base. I lost my temper and pushed him over.\n \nThat’s when the conflict started. Rasputin messaged me thereafter, saying that the container was gone. Whoever stole the container made it look like I was the guilty one so that the stalkers would go after me instead.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_11">
        <text>Who do you think is behind it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_12">
        <text>I have no idea. I know for sure that it couldn’t have been Rasputin, Skew, or Saurel, obviously. Beast, I beg you, go explain everything to Saurel. I don’t want things to be like this. I’m not afraid to die, but I don’t want to die as a rat.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_13">
        <text>I’ll go talk to him and get back to you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_14">
        <text>You won’t be able to contact me; I lost my PDA somewhere while escaping the bandits.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_15">
        <text>Then stay here and don’t move. I’ll come back to you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_17">
        <text>Beast, I beg you, speak to Saurel about letting me back. Okay?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_18">
        <text>Fine. I’ll speak to him.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_2">
        <text>Hey. Who are you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_3">
        <text>I’m Beast. I came here for you. Any last words?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_4">
        <text>Damn. Did Saurel send you here? Never saw you in the base before.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_5">
        <text>I arrived here yesterday while you were slipping away.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_6">
        <text>Oh, I didn’t slip away anywhere. I just went for a stroll to relax. Then Rasputin sent me a message about Limp’s death. Everyone thought I was the killer, and then the bandits went after me, and I couldn’t go back. And no! I didn’t kill Limp! He was like a brother to me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_7">
        <text>Only you had any reason to do it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_8">
        <text>Well, yeah. We had a bit of an argument, but I wouldn’t go so far as to kill a man because of mere trifle.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_levsha_first_meet_9">
        <text>Then who could’ve done it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_lutiy_monolit_dialog_0">
        <text>So, Beast, you ready to deal with these fanatics?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_lutiy_monolit_dialog_1">
        <text>I’m ready, though why did you decide to get mixed up in all of this?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_lutiy_monolit_dialog_2">
        <text>I wanted to help you out and thank you for everything that you did for me. It means a lot, and Sologub’s too short on experience to go on such missions.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_lutiy_monolit_dialog_3">
        <text>Hmm… Well, all right. Can we go?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_lutiy_monolit_dialog_4">
        <text>Yes. We’ll move right away; Petrovich already reconfigured my PDA. I don’t recommend taking the road that goes by the school. There are tons of anomalies there. Better stay on the path that stretches from the factory; it’s longer but safer.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_lutiy_monolit_dialog_5">
        <text>I’ll support you. Let’s move.</text>

        <text>This is all very strange…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_11">
        <text>Well, then. I’m guessing that scumbag lied to us and there won’t be any meeting?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_12">
        <text>It seems that way…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_14">
        <text>Fuck! It’s an ambush! Beast, get to cover ASAP! We’ll cover you!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_15">
        <text>What are you talking about? I’m staying with you!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_16">
        <text>No! Beast, there are too few of us. We won’t last five minutes in these numbers. Get to the stalkers for assistance this instant. Only you can convince them to help us. Go on! Get out of here! Time is short. Don’t worry about the exit. We’ll cover you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_17">
        <text>I’m off, Miklukha! You stay here, and I’ll get you some people.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_2">
        <text>So, we have some amount of time from the meeting with the Monolithians. One more thing left: we have to wait for the deal to begin, and then we smack that scum. Most importantly, we take out everyone and everything, and let no one escape. If anyone survives and runs off, then… We’ll be screwed, basically.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_3">
        <text>It’ll be all right. Just don’t make any fuss before we get our chance.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_4">
        <text>Agreed. Feeling nervous?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_5">
        <text>Not at all. When are we kicking it off?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_6">
        <text>Right now, Spotty’s hiding in one of the terminals while we’re staying in the shop. We’ll go through the northern entrance of the factory; it’ll be safer that way. On the way there, we need to clear the vicinity of any mutants so that they don’t come after us later when the fighting starts. You’ll come with me and help me out. I recommend you bring a silencer; attracting any attention won’t be in our favor.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_7">
        <text>Understood. Let’s move.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_miklucha_zavod_quest_9">
        <text>It’s quiet here… Too quiet. The fanatics should have set up a perimeter already, but there’s not a soul.</text>

    <string id="blck_val_monolith_story_group_0">
        <text>Tell me a story, brother.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_monolith_story_group_1">
        <text>My brother, the Monolith summoned me this night. I spoke with it. It was glorious in its splendor. I have almost been blinded by its light, which endowed me with great vigor! I know—I sense its might dwelling amongst us! It told me that only ardent faith is capable of vanquishing the wicked. It said that only the faithful will be blessed with its power. Furthermore, it revealed to me that our victory is impending!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_monolith_story_group_2">
        <text>My brother, have you heard that several infidels sneaked near the antennas recently? The Monolith guided us, and my brethren noticed them in time. One fell and evaporated. We’ve eliminated the second, and the third made a run for it. Cowards. They’re all cowards. Only true faith leaves no space for fear! Two ran away, but the Monolith is shrewd and omniscient. Hence, it needs them alive.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_monolith_story_group_3">
        <text>I remember us patrolling the edges of the Red Forest and stumbling upon a lone infidel. He had already started turning, and we haven’t killed him, but he was still existent in this half-beastly state… I realise that the sage Monolith has done it for us all: once again, he unmasked for us the true face of our enemy. Now our faith has been hardened more yet! It is nearing, my brother! The victory over the infidels is nearing, and then the Monolith shall fulfill our innermost desire! Rightfully shall it bless the devout with its presence; its glory; its magnificence! May we forever dwell in its brilliance!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_monolith_story_group_4">
        <text>Not long ago, the Monolith tested my faith, and I almost wandered off the righteous path. But I withstood! Praise the Monolith! Its challenges forge us! We were on our way back from the Dark Valley, and I fell slightly behind my brethren. The evil took this advantage and promptly started enticing me. And… I hesitated. The pure images were corrupted; the enemy whispered to me that we’er merely slaves to the Monolith. But then it occurred to me: this was a challenge. I remembered the Monolith’s shine and might, and my will, my courage were restored. Since then, I fear no challenge and know no hesitation. Praise the Monolith!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_monolith_story_group_5">
        <text>I’ve been to the Dark Valley. The infidels are abundant there, since the Monolith’s power hasn’t reached these lands yet. We had been guarding. At night, we were attacked. We fought those animals fiercely. My brethren’s prowess was honored: the Monolith summoned them soon after. But for me, he prepared another challenge. My weapon wouldn’t fire. But then, the Monolith said: “You are with me, and my strength is with you. If you stay true to your faith, you shall crush your foes and move nearer to me!” And I became a shadow. I crouched and crept towards their right. The daft, foolish spies were blind to it. They though that they’d finish with us and laughed over the hollow bodies of our brethren. But I had already faced their backs. And the Monolith’s force struck them out of my hands. Thus, it killed them. I’m gleeful to serve you, the Supreme one!</text>

    <string id="blck_val_sologub_help_meet_15">
        <text>Yes… Petrovich gave me a transmitter so I could send the coordinates of an exit in the space bubble to the captives. After that was done, the stalkers appeared. It was Fish and his men.</text>

    <string id="blck_val_sologub_help_meet_17">
        <text>Yeah. When I had just gotten into the Zone, he saved me and joined me up with the mercenaries. Eventually, Fish was cast out from the Syndicate, and he counted on me to come with him. I stayed. Fish blamed me for it and made it clear that we would see each other again. I didn’t hear from Fish for the longest time, but then someone messaged me and told me that he and his squad were found dead in Yantar. And this whole time, I thought he was dead.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_sologub_help_meet_18">
        <text>So he most likely died.</text>

        <text>I might as well tell you another thing: the figure you saw next to me; I met him before in the space bubble. He’s very dangerous. It’s good you showed up when you did and saved me. Thank you again. Now, excuse me. I need to have a word with Petrovich.</text>

He wasn’t where he should’ve been after the fall. No reply on my PDA, either. I panicked and decided on abandoning the mission and going back. Humpback was dead set on finding Spotty, but that would’ve been suicide for us. Still, I went with Humpback’s plan. He descended the slope to look for Spotty where he should’ve been.

        <text>Glad you’re okay, merc. I won’t be questioning you about what happened about the factory; if you have anything to share, just say it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_12">
        <text>It’s all right. Don’t let it go to your head. What info did Miklukha have on his PDA?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_13">
        <text>Okay. Let’s take a look at the PDA’s contents. Petrovich didn’t manage to decrypt all of the entries, but we managed to find some useful information nonetheless. Miklukha had a spare plan for driving the Monolithians out of the Outpost. It was rather simple: acquire a Monolith disguise, infiltrate their base, and destroy the structure with explosives. I think this plan deserves a try, but first, we need to get hold of a Monolith bodysuit, as well as one of their PDAs. That task will be up to you and Sologub. After you find a disguise, meet up with Sologub in the base, set up the explosive charges, then detonate them and return back here. That’s the plan.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_14">
        <text>Not a bad idea, but where do I get two Monolith outfits?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_15">
        <text>I checked all my channels. There’s a trader offering us two Monolith suits, but in exchange, he wants an SR-3 Vikhr assault rifle. I have no clue where to find such a gun. Rasputin’s suppliers can’t get a hold of it, either. Can you check your channels?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_16">
        <text>My channels won’t be of any help. After what happened in the space bubble, it’s best to not contact the Syndicate at all.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_17">
        <text>That’s bad, but still, try to ask around about this. Perhaps we might find a Vikhr rifle.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_18">
        <text>Fine. I’ll try to get a hold of it. We’ll talk later.</text>

    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_2">
        <text>What is it, mercenary?</text>

        <text>What is it, mercenary?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_22">
        <text>Beast, where have you been? Some shit happened. The bandits that were in the cage escaped last night. What I don’t understand is how they were able to get out in the first place. I have a suspicion one of my men helped them. You haven’t noticed anything shady recently, have you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_23">
        <text>Nope. Haven’t noticed anything shady… By the way, I have the rifle for the trader.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_24">
        <text>All right. I’ll deal with the escape a bit later. Where’d you get that shooter?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_25">
        <text>Well… Some old contacts helped me out…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_26">
        <text>Very good. Now we can bring Miklukha’s plan to life and wipe out the Monolithians once and for all. Oh, yeah, we decrypted another entry on Miklukha’s PDA. Turns out there’s a laboratory under the Outpost that’s used by the Monolith to bring in munitions and new fighters.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_27">
        <text>This just keeps getting better… Anyway, first we need to strike at their base in the construction site. We’ll go on from there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_28">
        <text>Piece of cake. We’ll need to wait for the bodysuits, though. Don’t know how long it’ll take for them to arrive. Give me the rifle; I’ll send it to the trader for him to give us the package.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_29">
        <text>Gotcha. Here you go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_3">
        <text>The Freedomers are pinned down by the Monolith at the factory. I need your help, Saurel. Give me a few good men so I can help Miklukha.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_30">
        <text>Okay. You can go. As soon as I get the package with the suits, I’ll contact you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_31">
        <text>Understood. See you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_33">
        <text>The package has yet to arrive, Beast. Drop by later, okay?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_35">
        <text>Great news, Beast! The package with the outfits has arrived. Now we can get to work and carry out our previously mentioned plan. You ready?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_36">
        <text>Guess I’m ready.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_37">
        <text>I know, I know: the plan’s not ideal, and there’s a chance they’ll see through you, but that chance is small as all hell. Monolithians are mindless; they won’t realize it’s a setup.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_38">
        <text>All right. Where’s Sologub right now? Is he good to go?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_39">
        <text>Ah, yeah: regarding Sologub, he’s not going with you… Savage, on the other hand, was itching to be his replacement. At first, I didn’t consent, but in the end, I figured things would be easier with him by your side. He’s already donned a bodysuit, and is waiting for you downstairs. First, though, go see Petrovich. He’ll reconfigure yours and Savage’s PDAs.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_4">
        <text>Sorry, but I can’t risk my own men. You got out, and that’s what’s matters. The rest do not. We’re not close enough to the Freedomers to die for their sake.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_40">
        <text>Give me the rundown once more, then I’ll go talk to Petrovich.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_41">
        <text>All right. Here’s the plan: you and Savage will infiltrate the Monolith base. Once you’re in, you’ll attach the explosive charges to the column on the second floor of the building while Savage tries to distract the Monolithians. After you set the charges, return to our base immediately so you don’t end up like the Monolith. That’s the plan. Now, take your Monolith bodysuit and the charges. Break a leg, you two.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_42">
        <text>Thank you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_44">
        <text>The package has yet to arrive, Beast. Drop by later, okay?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_46">
        <text>What happened there, Beast? Where’s Savage?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_47">
        <text>We were compromised… Seems the Monolithians took away Savage into the laboratory, and now they’re waiting for me to come save him. I don’t know what they thought up, but they need to lure me into the laboratory for something.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_48">
        <text>Well, then… Sad to see such a good plan lead to failure… So, there’s one thing I don’t understand: how do you know they brought Savage into the laboratory?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_49">
        <text>They knocked me out. When I came to, there was no one at the Monolith base except for a single Monolithian. He told me about it all.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_5">
        <text>How can you say that? If we don’t help them right this instant, they’ll die.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_50">
        <text>So there are no more Monolithians at the base? Did they all leave?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_51">
        <text>Yeah, but I doubt they’re leaving for good…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_52">
        <text>As I understand it, you’re setting out to rescue Savage, right? I doubt it’ll be worth it. It’s suicide. Just forget about it. On top of that, Hunter arrived at the farm half an hour ago. He was looking for you; said he’s ready to get you out of the Outpost. Just go to him. Savage is history by now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_53">
        <text>I need to save Savage. I can’t just leave him behind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_55">
        <text>Perhaps you’ll reconsider that ridiculous notion of yours? If you head into the laboratory, you’re as good as dead…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_56">
        <text>I need to save Savage.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_57">
        <text>Perhaps you’re right. There’s no guarantee Savage is still alive…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_58">
        <text>Exactly! My advice is to go to Petrovich. He’ll reset your PDA. After that, get out of that damn Monolith outfit and see Hunter. Just don’t go into that laboratory.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_59">
        <text>All right. So be it. I’ll talk to Petrovich and then go to Hunter.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_6">
        <text>They’re probably dead by now. I can’t risk my men, Beast.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_61">
        <text>Good luck, Beast! I hope we see each other again…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_63">
        <text>Hello, Beast. Have you managed to find any clues on where to get that SR-3 Vikhr?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_64">
        <text>Seems like it. One of the bandits in the farm cell told me that if I free them, he’ll get me a Vikhr.</text>

        <text>Those slippery bastards… Can’t we just put needles under their nails and get the location of the weapons that way?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_66">
        <text>They asked me to steal Sologub’s key at nighttime and hand it to them. In exchange, they’re giving me the gun. They also promised not to use any force; instead, they’ll just sneak out without any fuss..</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_67">
        <text>So that’s how it is… What do you think? Can they be trusted to keep their word?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_68">
        <text>I think we can trust them.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_69">
        <text>I don’t really think the bandits are trustworthy, but we have no other options right now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_7">
        <text>Ah, shit… Fine. I’ll try to save them myself.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_70">
        <text>We’ve made do this far… You’ll have to go along with their plan. However… I have an idea: we can play along with the bandits. I’ll give you the key to the cage. You pass it on to the bandits, and I’ll warn the guys on the farm so they’ll be ready for anything. If everything goes as planned and the bandits keep their word, we’ll let them live, but we don’t want to see them ever again. Does that sound good to you, Beast?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_71">
        <text>Sounds like a plan. Better than just stealing the key for the bandits.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_72">
        <text>I doubt that’ll work. The bandit told me the guns are held by a third party. I can only get them if the bandits are set free.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_73">
        <text>What god damn freedom plan did that bandit have in mind for you?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_74">
        <text>Okay, so, let’s do it like this: you take the key, tell them you stole it from Sologub, and after the “escape,” you come back to me and tell me about everything. Sound good?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_75">
        <text>Sounds good. Let’s do it.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_79">
        <text>How did it go, Beast?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_80">
        <text>The bandits escaped. No fuss, no muss. They told me I can come for the Vikhr at the old school in the morning. Here’s your key.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_81">
        <text>Well, then. Let’s see if they keep their word…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_82">
        <text>We’ll find out in the morning. No use in guessing.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_84">
        <text>Well, Beast. Did the bandits keep their word? Did you get the gun?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_85">
        <text>Surprisingly, yes. They kept their word. I have the SR-3 Vikhr.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_86">
        <text>Very good. Now we can bring Miklukha’s plan to life and wipe out the Monolithians once and for all. Oh, yeah, we decrypted another entry on Miklukha’s PDA. Turns out there’s a laboratory under the Outpost that’s used by the Monolith to acquire munitions and new fighters.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_87">
        <text>This just keeps getting better… Anyway, first we need to strike at their base in the construction site. We’ll go on from there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_88">
        <text>The bandits escaped. No fuss, no muss. They told me I can come for the Vikhr at the old school in the morning. Now I’ll go return both your key and Sologub’s key.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_9">
        <text>What is it, mercenary?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_91">
        <text>What is it, Beast?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_92">
        <text>Let’s chat after you give the key to the bandits. All right?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_stavrid_zavod_zasada_93">
        <text>All right. I’m going.</text>

        <text>Listen, Rasputin: I’m looking for a rifle. It’s called the SR-3 Vikhr. Can you get a hold of it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_vihr_meet_1_1">
        <text>I already spoke to Saurel about that. I can only tell you the same thing: my suppliers don’t have the means to acquire that rifle. It’s a very rare piece.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_vihr_meet_1_2">
        <text>Okay. Thanks for the answer.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_vihr_meet_1_3">
        <text>Not at all. If you ever need help, come see me.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="blck_val_vihr_meet_2_1">
        <text>You gonna exchange it for those Monolith suits kept by the trader? Nah, I don’t know. There’s one thing I can tell you: if Rasputin can’t find that rifle, there’s a fat chance anyone else will. Sad truth.</text>

        <text>N-no… Got no idea… I don’t need your p-problems… I already h-have my own……</text>

        <text>No clue. If Rasputin can’t help you with that, go see Petrovich. Maybe he can get it for you.</text>

        <text>Hi, Petrovich. I’m trying to find an SR-3 Vikhr rifle. Any chance you can get a hold of one?</text>

        <text>Hmm. No. I won’t be able to find one, and I doubt anyone else in the Outpost can.</text>
