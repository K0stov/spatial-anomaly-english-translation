        <text>Damn, you sacred me beast! I didn't think it was possible for a person to be knocked out for so long. Speaking of which: Oh man, are we in deep shit. </text>

        <text>The hell? What happened?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="digst_markus_talk_to_actor_2">
        <text>I don't know, but I'm sure it's nothing good. That creature must be playing tricks on us. Going to that place was a huge mistake. The minute I sent you that message, somebody whacked me over the head and I woke up here.  I think this must be the monster's lair. At first, I was happy because I thought I was out of the anomaly but when I opened my PDA, It turned out that I was still inside it. It turns out we are still inside the anomaly, only beneath the ground.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="digst_markus_talk_to_actor_3">
        <text>Yeah, that's sad news indeed. What creature are you talking about?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="digst_markus_talk_to_actor_4">
        <text>I saw it a few times but I didn't say a word about it to anyone.  I thought that everyone would think I've gone off the deep end but I assure this creature is real. Physically the mutant looks like a bloodsucker but it acts and talks like a human being and it wears clothes like one. Also when it was close to me, I could see a profile in my contacts list with the name "Stronglav". But that's not the worst part. When I tried to shoot it, the creature just disappeared instantly and it was laughing at me beast, it fucking laughed. I don't even know what to do...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="digst_markus_talk_to_actor_5">
        <text>I also saw that creature but I thought it was just a hallucination. We need to find way out of here. Marcus, don't worry, we'll get out of here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="digst_markus_talk_to_actor_6">
        <text>You think I didn't try that? Further into the cave there's a ladder leading upwards but if you try to go there something teleports you back. Hold on... Can you feel that?!</text>
    </string>
    <string id="digst_markus_talk_to_actor_7">
        <text>What am I supposed to feel?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="digst_markus_talk_to_actor_8">
        <text>That smell... It's like something is burning. That's the scent I felt when I saw that creature for the first time. Don't move, I think the owner of this lair is coming back.</text>

        <text>I don't know man, I wanted to ice that creature once and for all... What the hell happened?</text>

        <text>Alas, I only have two vaccines vial to give out and I can't give it out to all three of you. I decided to give one of them to you.</text>

    <string id="pb_actor_give_dubolom_medicament_11">
        <text>No, Beast, I won't take it, I rather you give it out to the other guys. Those two have their whole lives ahead of them, while I lived through most of mine. I much rather you save them, instead of me.</text>

        <text>I'm rooting for you, man.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_10">
        <text>Well, there isn't much of a choice over here so you're gonna have to adapt. You should go and kill a few boars and cook their meat on the campfire. Hey, I know it's not exactly gourmet but at least you won't be hungry.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_11">
        <text>What is it, merc?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_12">
        <text>Alright, if that's the way it is then so be it. Is that all?</text>

    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_13">
        <text>I'm running out of supplies and Savage said you can help me with that.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_14">
        <text>I don't know if you are aware of this but we don't really have any food left. Our last stock of canned goods and doctor's sausages came from you. We have already ran out and that's why we are going to have to go back to eating boar and blind dog even though it's poisonous. However if it's prepared correctly, it should be safe to eat.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_15">
        <text>I didn't think I'd ever have to eat the local wild life but sense there isn't any other choice...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_16">
        <text>How do you I prepare the meat correctly then?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_17">
        <text>I tell you what: First try and cook a piece and when you're done, I'll tell you wither you did right or not. But when you're craving the boar, try to keep the fatty parts, they are tastier.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_18">
        <text>Fine, I'll do that now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_2">
        <text>Hold on, I know you... You are that same mercenary who helped me hunt down that psi-dog, am I right?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_20">
        <text>So Beast, have you brought the meat?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_21">
        <text>Yeah, here you go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_22">
        <text>Not yet.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_23">
        <text>Yeah, you did everything correctly, this is perfectly edible. There's almost no chance of getting poisoned from this.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_24">
        <text>Thanks for the very needed advice. At least, I have some steady source of food now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_25">
        <text>Don't mention it, merc. I hope that you remembered what you did there, it's important that you do.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_26">
        <text>I remember, don't worry. Aight, I got to go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_28">
        <text>What do you need, merc?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_3">
        <text>Yeah, you're right. It turns out the zone is smaller than I thought.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_30">
        <text>What do you need, merc?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_4">
        <text>Yeah, I agree. You guys sure caused some havoc back then... Don't worry, I won't say a word about it to anyone. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_5">
        <text>Everything that went down there was my job and nothing more.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_meet_after_dialog_6">
        <text>Whatever you say... Alright, I won't take any more of your time. See ya.</text>

        <text>Hey.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_is_time_1">
        <text>Excellent, that means we can move out right now. The chimera should already be at the bunker.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_is_time_2">
        <text>I told you already, the chimera only goes to the bunker after midnight so you should know it's way too early now. Come back at round 2 a.m. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_is_time_3">
        <text>Let's go then.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_is_time_4">
        <text>Got it, I'll come by then.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_10">
        <text>Alright, that's all I needed to know.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_11">
        <text>The chimera only appears in the bunker during nighttime, so we might as well go right now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_12">
        <text>Alright then, get over here at around 2 a.m, that's the time the chimera usually appears at the bunker.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_13">
        <text>Hey, Beast, what's up?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_14">
        <text>Let's get going then.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_15">
        <text>Alright, I'll to talk to you again at night.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_17">
        <text>Great, now we don't have to worry about that chimera sneaking into our base any longer. Thanks for your help, Beast.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_18">
        <text>Don't mention it, this chimera being dead benefits us all anyway. Hell, even I will sleep better knowing that this creature is dead.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_19">
        <text>Yeah. By the way, I bet you have noticed that are food sources are running out. The thing is, I have, for a week, been trying out this new source of food.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_2">
        <text>Hey, Beast, I heard you found Scavenger... Yeah, I never expected him to be such a piece of shit but what's done is done. Anyway, I have something important to discuss with you.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_20">
        <text>And what is this new source of food?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_21">
        <text>While everyone else eats their canned goods, I have been eating the local wildlife. There's a chance, of course, that by eating that type of meat you can get poisoned but if you cook it correctly then you shouldn't have anything worry about.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_22">
        <text>Nothing wrong with that. Sure it's not some gourmet dish but a wild boar is perfectly edible. I have tried their meat before. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_23">
        <text>I knew that you would get me, Beast. However, boars aren't the only animal that's edible here. Blind dog meat, for example, is far tastier and softer.  Listen, how about we try and cook some of that meat right now? Go and hunt a few boars and try to prepare their meat in the campfire. At least we will have steady source of food that way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_24">
        <text>Yeah, sure. I was getting hungry anyway.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_25">
        <text>Listen, can you bring me a piece as well, all this hunting has made me hungry.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_26">
        <text>Sure thing, Knucklehead.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_28">
        <text>So what's up, Beast, have you brought the meat?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_29">
        <text>Yeah, here you go.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_3">
        <text>Alright, tell me what's up, I'm all ears.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_30">
        <text>Not yet.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_31">
        <text>Alright... You even cooked it right, nice! Keeping cooking it this way, it's the safest method. Anyway, Thanks.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_32">
        <text>Thanks for the advice. Good to know that there's a food source always nearby.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_33">
        <text>By the way, before I forget, Marcus told me he wants to talk to you about something. Go see him, once you have some free time.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_4">
        <text>We have a serious situation on our hands:  A few days ago, I spotted a chimera not far from our base and sense I was alone and didn't have much ammo, so I didn't fight it... Good thing it didn't see me. This is a very dangerous creature and if it sneaks into our base at night then we are all as good as dead.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_5">
        <text>What do you suggest we do?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_6">
        <text>We need to eliminate it. The safest way to do it is at night; when the mutant goes it sleep in its lair, in the bunker. The two of us can handle a sleeping chimera without a problem, it won't even know what hit it. What do you think?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_7">

    <string id="pb_dubolom_night_hunting_start_8">
        <text>First of all, we are the only ones with enough ammo for the job and second, Two guys against a sleeping chimera is way more than enough. I fought these beasts before and I know this shouldn't be a problem.</text>

        <text>About your gun...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_give_weapon_1">
        <text>So, did you find it?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_give_weapon_2">
        <text>Yeah, here it is, take it. By the way, the bloodsucker that sacred you was waiting for me there.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_give_weapon_3">
        <text>Not yet.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_give_weapon_4">
        <text>Nah man, he didn't scare me, I just had no other choice but to run.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_give_weapon_5">
        <text>Stop making excuses, I don't care either way. Here's your gun.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_give_weapon_6">
        <text>Thanks man, really appreciate it. Now I can go on raids like everyone else and not stay behind. Plus it's a lot safer here when you have a gun. Here's a small reward for your good work. I don't need this money here anyway but perhaps you will need it later.  </text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_give_weapon_7">
        <text>Thanks. I'll be on my way.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_quest_weapon_0">
        <text>So... Where did you lose your gun? Can you at least give me a ballpark location?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_quest_weapon_1">
        <text>I can tell you the exact location and I know where the gun is.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_quest_weapon_2">
        <text>So what's the problem then? Why can't you just get the gun yourself? It would take less effort then bothering me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_quest_weapon_3">
        <text>The thing is, I didn't lose the gun, I threw it away. When I was scouting, I was attacked by a bloodsucker and my gun jammed. I had no time to clear the malfunction, so I threw the gun at the bloodsucker, shot him a few times with my pistol and ran away. I can't tell that to the general because running away from a mutant is considered a cowardly act  and going out there alone with a single handgun is near suicide. Help me out here merc, I'll owe you big time.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_quest_weapon_4">
        <text>Well, what can you do? Alright I'll look for your gun.</text>

        <text>Take it easy lieutenant. I'm a mercenary and I came here you to reactivate the transformer.</text>

        <text>Let's pretend I believe you... How did you open the cage door?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_start_dialog_3">
        <text>Someone helped me open it. What about you? How long have you been stuck here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_start_dialog_4">
        <text>And you think I'm going to tell you all that? Go talk to the general, he should be more inclined to discuss these things.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_bunchuk_start_dialog_5">
        <text>Fine, I'll go talk to him then.</text>

        <text>The fuck? I can't walk up to you. I'm trying to get to you but I keep getting teleported back. What the fuck is going on?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_tachenko_final_dialog_2">
        <text>An anomaly, most likely... Only really small. I can't get out of here and I've ran out of food and water. As for the other guys well, one guy disappeared somewhere while the rest are all dead. The major, he went batshit all of a sudden and started killing people after which he shot himself in the head. So I am left here alone.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_tachenko_final_dialog_3">
        <text>Hold on, I was just here a while back and everything was fine. You sent me message just a second ago? How the hell did all of this happen so fast?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_tachenko_final_dialog_4">
        <text>A while back? A whole week has passed sense the moment I sent you that message. After that, I tried to make contact but my pda died all of a sudden.</text>

        <text>Greetings, stalker. Do you have some spare food by any chance? We are all just tired of eating mutant meat and are really craving some real food.</text>

    <string id="pb_duty_tachenko_start_dialog_12">
        <text>No, general, I don't. I could go for some human food myself right now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_tachenko_start_dialog_13">
        <text>Yeah, I thought so.  Listen, we are not asking for it for free. When we were out on our raid, we collected a couple of artifacts and wanted to sell them off the scientists but couldn't due to our current circumstance. How about you give us some food and we will give you the artifacts? Canned goods, sausages, bread...  We don't really care what as long as it's real food. Bring us at least 8 pieces. Deal?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_tachenko_start_dialog_14">
        <text>Alright, general. I'll try and find some food for you.</text>

        <text>Yeah, okay. Alright, you did your part, good job. Here's your artifacts, when you finally get out of here you can sell them for a good price. </text>

        <text>Great. Yeah, Only I'm not so sure we will ever get out of here, although I hope we do. Alright, goodbye general.</text>

    <string id="pb_duty_tachenko_start_dialog_24">
        <text>Hold on, stalker, there might be another job for you. When we were out of the bunker, Tug dropped his gun. Perhaps you can help him find it. </text>

        <text>Sure, I'll help. Where did he drop it, roughly?</text>

        <text>I'd like to know that myself... by the looks of it, we are inside some kind of anomaly. Do you remember how you got here?</text>

        <text>A spatial one.</text>
    </string>

        <text>A spatial one. You are not alone here by the way, there's a group of stalkers nearby and they have been stuck here for a while. More than 2 months to be exact. So, do you remember how you ended up in here?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_duty_tachenko_start_dialog_6">
        <text>Fuck, another "gift" from the zone. All, I remember is that we were walking through Agroprom and then we saw a bright light. After that, we woke up here.</text>

        <text>Good thing you've asked merc. Our generator is running out of fuel and there isn't any left in the jerry cans. If we don't find fuel for it then we won't have any electricity which means no light in our base. We need it to see mutants during night time. If you manage to find some fuel I'll give you a couple of bandages and a medkit. I'd give you more than that but you know how it is in this shithole.</text>

        <text>Yeah, Snake's a good dude and we managed to find something in common. This place forced has to work together, it's impossible to survive any other way here. Plus, I am far more concerned with getting out of here then fighting in some endless faction war.</text>

        <text>Alright, you should get them in a second.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_2">
        <text>Excellent work, Beast! Now, at the very least, we have some light. How did everything go?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_20">
        <text>Alright, I'll be on my way then.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_22">
        <text>Beast, let's talk later. First check the signal.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_24">
        <text>So Beast, Any good news? Have you managed to find any meds that may help our sick? their situation is really bad, if they don't get any medication in the next two days, they will surely die.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_25">
        <text>I did find some meds, for one use only though. What's worse though that there's isn't enough medication for everybody seeing that there only two doses of this shit. And even these two doses might not do anything... Man, we should have known eating mutant meat was a bad idea.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_26">
        <text>The important thing right now is not to give up. Right now, more than ever, we have to keep fighting. There's a different problem though: I don't think I can choose who gets the medication. Can you make that decision for me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_27">
        <text>It's a tough decision but some has to do it, I guess it's gonna have to be me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_28">
        <text>Thank you, I could have done it myself. Quick reminder, the people that are sick are: Knucklehead, Marcus, and Rizak. Good luck, Beast. </text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_29">
        <text>See you later.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_3">
        <text>When I was in the underground, I found a squad of dutyers. Five people to be exact.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_31">
        <text>Ну, Зверь, ты уже распределил лекарство?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_32">
        <text>Пока нет.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_34">
        <text>Тебя не было несколько дней, где ты пропадал так долго?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_35">
        <text>Я искал лекарство, а ночевал в сарае, там у меня было больше шансов встретить кого-то живого...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_36">
        <text>Увы, но спасти всех ты не успел, Дуболом скончался вчера ночью, мы похоронили его недалеко от базы...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_37">
        <text>А я так и не попрощался с ним...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_38">
        <text>Я и сам не успел с ним попрощаться, до последнего надеялся, что он сможет одолеть болезнь... Ты это, сказал, что медикаменты искал, удалось еще хоть несколько ампул найти? Маркус и Резак чувствуют себя уже лучше, но им нужно продолжать лечение. Ах да, вот это мы нашли в вещах Дуболома, кажется, это тебе.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_39">
        <text>Нет, больше вакцины я не нашел.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_4">
        <text>Ничего себе, вот так новость! И давно они там?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_40">
        <text>Жаль, будем надеятся, что одного вакцинирования хватит, чтобы одолеть болезнь полностью. Ну, ладно, что-то я заговорился здесь с тобой, иди отдохни, дай мне побыть одному.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_41">
        <text>Бывай, Лютый.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_5">
        <text>Нет, в аномалию они попали совсем недавно.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_6">
        <text>О нас ты им ничего не говорил?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_7">
        <text>Я рассказал им о нашей группе, но соединить наши группы не предлагал.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_8">
        <text>Ну, если они к нам не просились, то смысла предлагать им это нет. Главное, чтобы, когда у них еда закончится, они у нас её отнимать не пришли.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_after_quest_9">
        <text>Ничего, наёмникам дали отпор и им дадим, если потребуется.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_0">
        <text>Ты как, Зверь? Как там Шуруп, он в порядке? Думаю, что Маркус уже сообщил тебе, что здесь произошло.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_1">
        <text>Да, все хорошо, я убил всех наёмников, что находились в сарае. С Шурупом все хорошо, да и со мной тоже.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_2">
        <text>Очень жаль, что Тесак этот и несколько братков его сбежали, уже наверное и с аномалии свалить успели. Ну, ничего, они еще ответят за смерть Кувалды.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_3">
        <text>Эта сволочь еще и дешифратор с собой унесла...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_4">
        <text>Значит ты все-таки его нашел? А впрочем, какая теперь разница... Ладно, слушай, у меня идея появилась одна, я уже с ребятами обсудил её, думаю и с тобой нужно поговорить по этому поводу. В общем, лучше нам остаться в этом бункере, тут и дверь есть и укрытие от выброса надежное. Что скажешь по этому поводу?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_5">
        <text>Думаю, что это хорошая идея, после случившегося глупо возвращаться в дырявый сарай, что у всех на виду.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_6">
        <text>Вот и я так думаю. Кстати, те наёмники, которых нам удалось взять в плен, в общем, они тоже попытались сбежать, пришлось их убить.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_7">
        <text>Они сделали свой выбор. Маркус уже рассказал тебе, что он нашел ключ от диспетчерской и теперь у нас есть боеприпасы?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_8">
        <text>Да, он мне уже рассказал об этом, это действительно хорошая новость. Ладно, трепать позже будем, сейчас нужно свет здесь включить. Ты когда в сарае свет вырубил, то он и здесь вырубился тоже. Я уже Шурупу написал, чтобы он обратно включить попробовал, но у него не вышло, видимо где-то здесь есть трансформатор и для того, чтобы включить свет его нужно перезапустить. Мы с Резаком нашли здесь кое-какие схемы, выяснилось, что трансформатор находится недалеко от сарая, в подземке. Поручаю его перезапуск тебе. Вход в эту подземку закрыт, но Шуруп написал, что сможет взломать замок, в общем, иди он будет ждать тебя рядом с входом в это подземелье.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_lutiy_scene_final_base_meet_9">
        <text>Понял, займусь этим прямо сейчас.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_0">
        <text>Что здесь произошло? Это ты их двоих уделал?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_1">
        <text>Это не я, опять появился этот Стронглав и заставил их застрелиться.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_2">
        <text>Нихрена себе, он и на такое способен?! Тогда нам повезло, что мы до сих пор живы... Ладно, сейчас важнее парней из плена вытащить, и у меня есть план.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_3">
        <text>Что за план?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_4">
        <text>На складе остался кое-кто из наших, их охраняет несколько наёмников, сначала нужно взять под контроль склад, а тогда вернемся сюда и освободим остальных.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_5">
        <text>Всё равно выбора нет, приступаем. И еще одно, как тебе удалось выбраться из норы?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_6">
        <text>Все просто, после того как ты вылез, я тоже попробовал это сделать и у меня получилось, я от радости чуть полные штаны не наложил. Ну все, хватит об этом, давай к делу, для начала нам нужна амуниция и я знаю где её можно взять. Иди за мной, объясню все на месте.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_7">
        <text>Ладно, пошли.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_end_2">
        <text>Вот мы и на месте, это старый военный резерв. Не знаю как долго здесь лежит это оружие, но будем надеяться, что оно до сих пор в отличном состоянии.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_end_3">
        <text>Как дверь собираешься открывать?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_end_4">
        <text>У меня всё на мази. Я ключ от этой двери нашел, в логове этого Стронглава. Кое-что отсюда я уже себе взял, думаю, что и ты сможешь здесь найти что-то полезное для себя. Вот ключ от двери, бери все, что сможешь унести на себе, я подожду снаружи.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_end_5">
        <text>Понял, подожди меня, я сейчас.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_end_7">
        <text>Зверь, давай в темпе, бери всё, что сможешь унести, я подожду снаружи.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_end_8">
        <text>Понял, подожди меня, я сейчас.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_0">
        <text>Ну, что там, готов уже?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_1">
        <text>Да, готов. Вот забирай ключ, пусть у тебя будет.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_2">
        <text>Значит слушай, большая часть группы сейчас в сарае, они для чего-то оставили там Шурупа, нужно попытаться его спасти. Самый простой способ сделать это - вырубить электричество в сарае и перебить их в темноте. Ну, как план? И еще одно, могу я задать вопрос?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_3">
        <text>План прост и понятен, а на счет вопроса я думаю, что сейчас не самое подходящее время для разговоров...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_4">
        <text>Да я как раз таки о сложившейся ситуации и хотел поговорить. Ты уверен, что сможешь вступить в бой с наёмниками, ведь ты наверное знаешь многих из них?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_5">
        <text>Смогу, у меня не было друзей среди наёмников.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_6">
        <text>Не совсем готов к этому, но выбора нет, это необходимо сделать.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_7">
        <text>Хм, неожиданный ответ, но это не мое дело уже. Ладно, тогда ты займись наёмниками в сарае, а я попытаюсь освободить остальных.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_8">
        <text>Это да... Ладно, тогда ты займись наёмниками в сарае, а я попытаюсь освободить остальных.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_alive_talk_to_actor_final_9">
        <text>Понял, ты иди, я как справлюсь - сразу же к вам на подмогу пойду.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_10">
        <text>Когда будешь готов, поговори со Змеем - он заодно тебе и метку поставит в КПК.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_11">
        <text>Понял, пойду я.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_13">
        <text>Зверь, нет времени болтать, нужно уничтожить тех плотей.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_15">
        <text>Приветствую, Зверь! Я заметил, что и сыщик с тебя не плохой, химеру с Дуболомом выследил, Падальщика сумел найти, более того о всех его грязных делах нам поведал.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_16">
        <text>К чему ты клонишь?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_17">
        <text>Помощь твоя нужна. Ещё до Лютого у нас был другой старший, кличка у него была - Гильза, хороший мужик был, но пропал...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_18">
        <text>И как давно он пропал?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_19">
        <text>Чуть больше месяца назад. Конечно, глупо верить, что он жив, но я словил сигнал его КПК несколько дней назад возле Заброшенного убежища, однако через секунду сигнал пропал, я обшарил весь тот подвал, но так ничего и не нашел. Может быть он как и Падальщик по телепортам перемещается, выход ищет или выбраться не может... Попробуй разыскать его, Зверь.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_2">
        <text>Слушай, какие разговоры?! У нас тут зомбированные под боком, а достаточное количество патронов только у тебя и Москита. Ты бы сходил и убил этих безмозглых для начала, а потом и поговорим.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_20">
        <text>Хм, думаешь, что он смог продержаться столько времени в одиночку?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_21">
        <text>Всякое может быть, мужиком он был крепким, экзоскелет и ПКМ при себе имел. Да и еды и патронов, на момент его пропажи, было у него достаточно. Гильза хорошо справлялся с обязанностями главы, ему удалось сгруппировать нас вместе, а у нас ведь тут сталкеры всех мастей.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_22">
        <text>Ладно, попробую найти этого Гильзу, может и получится что-то с этого.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_24">
        <text>Приветствую, наёмник! Мы пока не успели с тобой познакомиться, меня Маркусом кличут, ты нам здорово помог, у нас хоть какой-то запас патронов появился, что не может не радовать.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_25">
        <text>Будем знакомы, меня Зверем кличут, но ты и так должен знать об этом...</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_26">
        <text>Это да, значит данное место "Пространственной аномалией" именуется? Стало быть и выход отсюда все же есть, осталось только его найти... Ты сейчас не занят, мне твоя помощь нужна?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_27">
        <text>Не занят, что за помощь нужна?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_28">
        <text>Sorry, but I’m busy right now.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_29">
        <text>Ничего особо сложного, мне нужен артефакт "Выверт", он хорошо радиацию из организма выводит. Как видишь, гравитационных аномалий здесь хватает, он точно должен появляться в этих местах. Сам сходить не смогу, вокруг мутантов куча, а патронов у меня почти не осталось. С наградой не обижу, не переживай, есть у меня другой артефакт, он хоть и радиоактивен, но полезные свойства у него тоже есть.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_markus_start_dialog_30">
        <text>Ладно, попробую найти тебе "Выверт".</text>

        <text>Да, он у меня.</text>

        <text>Так это же отлично! Можно будет забыть о антирадах, а то у меня их недели две как нет, артефакт отлично их заменит. Давай его сюда.</text>

        <text>В общем, лежит у меня здесь неподалеку в схроне СВД. Хорошая снайперка, но патронов у меня к ней нет. Можешь поискать, для меня, патроны к ней? Найти для начала пачку хотя бы? Взамен дам тебе патроны к калашу, у меня как раз заначка появилась, да и деньжат сверху накину. Ну что, поможешь мне?</text>

        <text>Нет, они здесь по другим причинам... Артефакт "Компас" ищут, думают, что мы нашли его, из-за этого Кувалду убили, суки.</text>

    <string id="pb_murad_prison_meet_2">

        <text>Да, наёмник. Чего тебе?</text>

        <text>Спасибо за помощь, мужик. Теперь, думаю, поговорить можно.</text>

        <text>Ты сказал, что за тобой гнались наёмники, почему?</text>

    <string id="pb_murad_quest_end_dialog_4">
        <text>В общем, дали мне ученые, по контракту радиопередатчик, протестируй мол и все дела. Я крутил эту хреновину и случайно на закрытый канал наёмников вышел, ох и переговоры у них были, слушал я это все, рот открыв, и не оглядывался даже. А тут, наёмники поняли, что кто-то их связь палит, и передали всем своим окрестность прочесать. Ну тут и началось, из-за куста уже через минуту повалили наёмники. Я по случайность в аномалию сиганул, хорошо еще, что это не карусель какая-нибудь оказалась, а пространка. Вот так вот.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_murad_quest_end_dialog_5">
        <text>А этот радиопередатчик еще у тебя?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_murad_quest_end_dialog_6">
        <text>Он со мной, но, похоже, при перемещении сюда я разбил его, во время побега от наёмников я его в рюкзак засунул, а когда из аномалии вывалился, то на этот же рюкзак и плюхнулся, он теперь на конструктор стал похож.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_murad_quest_end_dialog_7">
        <text>Что-то из деталей этого передатчика уцелело?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_murad_quest_end_dialog_8">
        <text>Ладно, давай сюда аккумулятор, пусть пока полежит у меня. Пойду я.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_murad_quest_end_dialog_9">
        <text>Пара микросхем, но они бесполезны и аккумулятор, могу отдать тебе, если нужен.</text>

    <string id="pb_otshelnik_puzir_talk_0">
        <text>Наёмник, тебе крупно повезло, что фантом не тронул тебя. Если бы ты не прошел его испытание, то уже никогда бы не смог проснуться. Фантомы очень коварны, но то, что их порождает - в разы опаснее.</text>

    <string id="pb_otshelnik_puzir_talk_4">
        <text>То, что ты видел здесь прошлой ночью и было фантомом. Фантомы - это души погибших людей, они появляются на месте своей гибели или поблизости от своего мёртвого тела. Обычно они не опасны, но того фантома, что ты видел создали чтобы заманить кого-то в ловушку.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_otshelnik_puzir_talk_5">
        <text>Тогда у того, кто это сделал, ничего не получилось, я ведь выбрался.</text>

        <text>Тебе повезло больше, чем сталкеру, что попал в ловушку до тебя, но нельзя постоянно опираться только на везение, она может подвести. Будь бдителен, наёмник, и не дай еще раз заманить себя в ловушку.</text>

        <text>Welcome back from the world beyond, buddy… Nobody was thinking you’d be coming back to your senses; you were unconscious for four days. Hmm… That blowout messed you up bad. Nobody would’ve survived that… or so we thought. You’re alive. Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing is something I don’t know. The fact remains that this is very strange, though. Very strange indeed. Anyway: you seem to be an all right man, but your merc attributes seem a little suspicious. Whose side are you on?</text>

    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_start_18">
        <text>I’m Beast: a mercenary… What is this place, and who are you?…</text>

    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_start_19">
        <text>Hmm. A mercenary? Looks like I was right… Well then, merc: answering your first question is going to be difficult, because I myself don’t know where exactly we are. This place here is mystical; we’ve been here for a long time, and all the while, the Zone’s been messing with us. I’m Savage. Nice to meet you. By the way, though, the guys aren’t very happy about having a mercenary around here, so I’m going to ask you to behave yourself. We’re all in a rather difficult situation; many nerves have been shot around here. Let’s all get along here and manage without any conflicts.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_start_2">
        <text>Merc, now would be a great time for your assistance… Zombies are approaching our base. We have to take them out, or this place is going to be overrun within seconds.</text>

        <text>I don’t know, merc. There’s no way out of here… You go anywhere, you always end up back at this godforsaken barn. We barely make ends meet around here, living another day without escaping malnutrition or any of the local mutants. Lost a lot of munitions, too, and that’s not counting any of the mutants. Only God knows how they keep finding a way here.</text>

    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_start_23">
        <text>Another stalker and I have been holed up here for about seven months. The others: about one to three months… As for your equipment, four days ago, one of our men scouted the neighborhood and stumbled upon your unconscious self. I have no idea about the location of your stuff. All you had on you was a pistol, a few magazines, and your suit, which was close to looking like a floorcloth. It’s obvious that I can’t force you to follow my orders, but I suggest you join our group so that you’ll have a chance of biting the dust a little later than if you go on by yourself. In addition, we’d be very interested in having a man of your talents around. I hope you’ve heard my words and understood everything; otherwise, you’ll have a few more problems on your hands.</text>

        <text>We don’t have time to worry about that. You need to help Cutter. He’s the one who you brought you here, even if some of our men were against it. Now, it’s your turn to repay the favor. And, I noticed a few Kalashnikov mags in your uniform. If you hand me two of them, I can help you out. Deal?</text>

        <text>Beast, if it wasn’t for Scavenger, we’d all be dead right now. He combed the whole area and gathered valuable supplies from corpses. Two days ago, he left camp and still hasn’t returned… He picked up on a signal not far from the base, then went to check it out and never got back. I sent a few guys to look for him, Cutter and Mosquito, but they didn’t find him. Instead, what they found was you. Here’s what I don’t get, though: how did you manage to survive in the first place? There were blind dogs no further than ten meters from where you were found.</text>

        <text>Speak to Knucklehead on that matter. He’ll help you solve the issue. Oh, also, Snake wanted to see you. Said that he’s got an important matter. After you’re done with that, you come to me. I’ve got something else for you.</text>

        <text>I need your help with a little something… We had this stalker. Called him Scavenger. He went missing two days ago, but I don’t want to think that he’s dead.</text>

    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_after_heli_crash_4">
        <text>Yeah. No need to bother him right now. I’m quite sure we have enough medicine to get him on his feet eventually. Too bad we have no actual medics. By the way, I see you’re looking much better than before. Sleep did you some good.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_after_heli_crash_5">

    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_after_heli_crash_9">
        <text>Yeah. Scavenger combed the whole area and gathered valuable supplies from corpses. Two days ago, he left camp and still hasn’t returned. He picked up on a signal not far from the base, then went to check it out and never got back. I sent a few guys to look for him, Cutter and Mosquito, but they didn’t find him. Instead, what they found was you. Here’s what I don’t get, though: how did you manage to survive in the first place? There were blind dogs no further than ten meters from where you were found.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_to_controller_kill_0">

    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_to_dead_zombied_9">
        <text>The note describes this very place: we’re inside some kind of anomaly. The Dutyer described this anomaly as spatial. I’ve heard about it before…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_to_go_sleep_0">
        <text>Damn. My head… What the hell attacked us?! Okay, at least we know how the zombified stalkers ended up here, even if an unexpected guest showed up at our doorstep. Hey, I wonder: why didn’t you fall under its influence like everyone else?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_to_go_sleep_1">
        <text>I don’t know. I did fall under the control of one of those mutants in the past. It almost managed to zombify me, but then Fish saved me.</text>

        <text>That Fish is certainly a good man. Anyway… Good thing you managed to steer clear of that controller’s influence, else we’d all have been on a leash. What was I thinking?… With our security, anyone can waltz in here without a problem. The really scary part is that this zombies have been wandering around this barn for a while, and that means that the controller was also under our nose this whole time…</text>

    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_to_go_sleep_3">
        <text>Right now, we need to get the guys some more ammo. We won’t be able to protect ourselves otherwise.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_to_go_sleep_4">
        <text>You’re right about that, but the ammo shortage isn’t our main problem: our food supply is almost out, and we’ve got almost no drinking water. The morale here is dropping every day. Many of them are saying that there’s no way out of here and that we’re all going to die starving. I do get such thoughts myself from time to time, but I try to keep them at bay.</text>

        <text>I hope we can still find a way out of here, because I don’t want to die here. I didn’t think that the Zone would give me such a horrible present; to live out my days in this cage. I want to go back home to my wife and daughter. Why in the hell has this Zone entrapped me?</text>

    <string id="pb_quest_line_lutiy_talk_to_go_sleep_8">
        <text>Listen, Beast: you look pretty beat up. You spent a lot of time in that bed, blacked out, but I can see it didn’t help you nothing. A face-to-face meeting with a controller isn’t the best medicine, either. Go and rest up; seeing you is painful. We’ll talk more in the morning. In the meantime, the guys and I are going to deal with the corpse of that controller.</text>

    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_snake_start_13">
        <text>Then let’s go.</text>

        <text>Hey. Did you need something from me?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_snake_start_16">
        <text>Yes, Beast. As you can see, we have a shortage of food and munitions. That’s not our only issue; on top of that, our amount of drinking water is dangerously low. I mean, there’s a well outside the barn, but the water in there is radioactive, and drinking any of it without any prior purification is life-threatening. But there is, in fact, a way to purify it. From time to time, you can find an anomalous plant inside this anomaly. At one point, I helped the scientists at Yantar with purifying water, and they did it by boiling the flower in the water.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_snake_start_17">
        <text>You want me to go flower picking? Not my style.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_snake_start_18">
        <text>No, Beast. You won’t have to pick anything. Cutter sent me the locations of a few such plants; he spotted them from the tower. You just have to stay by my side. The place is crawling with mutants, and I don’t have a lot of ammo to deal with them on my own. Will you give me a hand?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_snake_start_19">
        <text>All right. I’ll cover you. When are we heading out?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_snake_start_2">
        <text>Merc, we can talk later. Right now, you should deal with the zombies together with Mosquito.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_line_snake_start_20">
        <text>Right now. If you’re ready, of course…</text>

        <text>We’re back, safe and sound. I have the plants. Thanks for covering me, Beast. Now, I’ll be able to work with purifying the water for the men. These plants should suffice for at least some time. By the way, if you run out of water, come see me, and I’ll be able to provide you some.</text>

        <text>I’ve changed my mind.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_lutiy_meet_to_all_11">
        <text>Cutter’s a strict man. He’s hard to understand, but he doesn’t cause a lot of conflict; on the contrary, he helps break up any arguing in the group, if it ever comes up. He ended up in the anomaly about two months ago. He couldn’t get it together for the longest time, but nonetheless, he adapted. His main role is reconnaissance, which used to be Scavenger’s thing. All in all, he’s a decent guy, but as of late, he’s been pretty down; he keeps talking nonsense about us being stuck here forever.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_lutiy_meet_to_all_12">
        <text>Thanks for the info.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_lutiy_meet_to_all_13">
        <text>About Sledge? Well, he went through thick and thin in his days. He’s like steel; a force of nature. Not a man. I knew him from before the whole fiasco with the anomaly. Back then, he worked with Freedom at the military warehouses. Everybody there cherished and respected him, but after he appeared here, he became different. He found friends among enemies here and generally became a kinder person. He’s been with us for about two and a half months.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_lutiy_meet_to_all_14">
        <text>Hm. So this place has some kind of use. Thanks for the info.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_lutiy_meet_to_all_15">
        <text>Quite a young fellow, who made the mistake of joining Duty; or rather, that’s what he believes. If he gains experience, he might become a very good fighter one day, but if he gets out of here, he probably won’t be joining up with his faction again. He made friends with Sledgehammer, though they both got pretty hot-headed when they first met ’cause of Sledge’s time in Freedom. He’s been here for almost over a month.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_quest_lutiy_meet_to_all_16">
        <text>Markus is the musician here, and, if I may say, my right hand man. If there’s ever something I can’t quite deal with on my own, he’s always there to help me. He was part of the original group that ended up in here. We had a third guy, but let’s leave that for now. You could say that we brought some order to this place, if you can call it “order.” Eventually, some new stalkers came along, including yourself.</text>

        <text>Without Knucklehead, we’d have been much worse off. He’s a hunter and a gatherer. After Scavenger came here, they’ve both been helping the group by supplying us with mutant meat. I don’t know how things would work out here without him. He’s been with us for over three months.</text>

        <text>Not much I need to say about Screw. He’s the heart of our group. Without him, we wouldn’t be able to maintain any of our equipment, and without equipment, we wouldn’t last very long. The guys hand him all sorts of trash, which he buys for money, and then, with the help of that trash, he fixes all of our gear. He doesn’t do it for free, but that doesn’t matter to us. He got here about a week ago or two after us, and since then, he’s been a steady helping hand.</text>

Shell was the leader of our detachment, and he remained our leader after our appearance in the anomaly… well, until he disappeared, after which I assumed his position.</text>

        <text>I don’t know, but even if we do find a way, not everyone will make it. That’s for sure. I’m still amazed that we’ve been able to hold out for this long. Not only do we barely have any grub or munitions, but we have more dangerous concerns. I left the barn the night before yesterday to get some fresh air, and I could smell burning. I thought, “Maybe something’s burning…” but then I saw a huge pillar of smoke, and I could make out someone standing in the center of it. I looked through my binoculars to see who it was, but I couldn’t make out rat shit from dog shit. I decided to take a closer look, and suddenly, there was a laughter. All that smoke was gone, and so was the figure who stood in it. I don’t know what the heck that was, but it sure wasn’t anything good for us. It didn’t bode well.</text>

    <string id="pb_rezak_first_meet_19">
        <text>I’m a stalker; a loner. I made a living working under Sidorovich, and after that, I set off to Yantar for science. They’ve got regular-paying jobs and medical supplies, and the military doesn’t poke their nose there. What sucks, though, is that those eggheads tend to send you to places so bad that even shit looks good in comparison. Before I ended up in this anomaly, I remember how I went up to an anomaly by myself at Yantar to gather a few specimens, and then all I saw was a white flash.</text>

You can bring me broken shooters, and I’ll buy them off you, though I don’t provide any repairs or modifications for free, because in the end, I’m going to get out of this place someday, so I try to gather whatever I can, and I also need to get hold of intact weapons in exchange for any parts.

        <text>No problem. Here’s your shooter. And, by the way, have a few rounds for it as a bonus. They were also in the container. It’s a rare caliber; a type that nobody here uses.

        <text>All right. Take the ammunition. What else… A Black Angel artifact. Not bad in its qualities; it gives you resistance to psy-fields. You want it?</text>

    <string id="pb_shurup_talk_to_open_habar_19">
        <text>Here. Take the artifact. Not much else is left in the container; only medical supplies and bullets, which I’ll give to Savage. He’ll distribute it among the group.</text>

        <text>Right. Let’s start with a 1PN58 scope. Very useful item. Contains a built-in night vision device, which’ll help you spot targets in the dark. It fits on weapons with dovetail-type rails.</text>

        <text>Mhm. Here’s your scope. Let’s keep looking… Right. Here’s a decent pea-shooter: the FN FNP-45. Not exactly up to date, but its destructive capabilities are not disappointing.</text>

        <text>You found tools for basic work? They surely won’t be of much use for any fine work, but they’ll be handy nonetheless. Thank you very much, merc. I’ll lower my prices for repairs and upgrades for you. Deal?</text>

        <text>We could do with fixing the radio transceiver that’s located in this basement. For that, we need to find a working battery and two copper wire coils. It’s gonna take some luck and persistence to find a battery in these parts, but since we ended up here in the first place, I wouldn’t say our chances are too high… Copper wiring should be pretty easy to find somewhere, but without a battery, this thing won’t work. All in all, if you find anything resembling a wire or a battery, bring it to me. I might actually be able to fix this thing, and then you can try to send a signal that’ll reach outside the anomaly. Someone will surely get the signal and help us in some way…</text>

    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_2">
        <text>Hey, merc. See, I’m resting up in here. Decided to go into the basement so that I don’t keep being an eyesore for the others. I think it’ll be better for everyone that way, including me.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_20">
        <text>I happened to find a battery all along. Another “lucky man” ended up in the anomaly and shared what he had.</text>

        <text>I’ve found two coils of copper wiring.</text>

        <text>Sad to hear about the stalker, but he’s helped us big time. I’d say I’m glad that he ended up here. So, hand me the battery. You sure it’s in working condition?</text>

    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_25">
        <text>Okay. Let’s see… Yeah. That should do it. It’s just that even if this thing works, I can’t get it to restart yet. Got no copper wiring to replace the already fried wiring in here. Try to find two coils with copper wiring, and then we’ll try to get this pile of trash working.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_26">
        <text>Okay. Let’s see… Yeah. That should do it. If everything works out and the transceiver successfully restarts, I can send a signal for help beyond the anomaly. Come back to me in about twenty minutes. In the meantime, I’ll try to replace all the fried wiring.</text>

        <text>Well, that’s relatively good news. Savage told me you wanted to have a chat with me. Is that right?</text>

    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_36">
        <text>Excellent, merc. Hand me the wiring. Too bad that not much will come out of it without a battery…</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_37">
        <text>Here you go. Regarding the battery, I’ll try to figure something out, though it seems more and more that we won’t be able to find anything that’ll work.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_38">
        <text>Well, in any case, keep me updated. All right?</text>

    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_4">
        <text>Yes, merc. Got a bit of an important task for you. In short terms, the radio transceiver that’s been lying in this basement can be fixed; I’ve had my moments with such devices before. The main thing of note is its broken battery, as well as some of the wiring having fried. I could use a couple of rolls with copper wiring and a new battery. Once I have all that, I might be able to breathe some life into that thing. It might save our day; if we get it working, we might be able to send a signal outside the borders of this forsaken anomaly, and if anyone gets the signal, maybe they can help us escape.</text>

    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_40">
        <text>Excellent, merc. Hand me the copper wiring and come back to me in about twenty minutes. I’ll try to get the battery and the fried wiring replaced.</text>

    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_44">
        <text>Come back in a little while, merc. I still need to get this thing repaired.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_46">
        <text>I managed to fix the damn transceiver after all. Now, we need to find someone that we can broadcast the signal to. That’ll be my business.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_47">
        <text>Did you pick up anything useful while you were fixing the transceiver?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_48">
        <text>It doesn’t seem like I’ve picked up anything. Might be a few phrases here and there along with some unintelligble muttering, but there are more than likely old broadcasts. I’ll keep scanning for any more signals, but nonetheless, thanks, merc, for helping me repair the transmitter. Who knows? Maybe it’ll can help us get out of here.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="pb_soldier_oleynik_meet_49">
        <text>No need to thank me. We’re all together in this. I’ll see you later.</text>

        <text>Good idea, but where am I going to find a battery, and one that still works, at that?</text>
